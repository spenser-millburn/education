What is a device driver
=========================

A device driver (often referred to as driverâ€™) is a piece of software that controls a particular type of device which is connected to the computer system

A device driver has three sides:
	one side talks to the rest of the kernel
	one talks to the hardware, 
	and one talks to the user
