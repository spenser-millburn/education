Types of Modules
===================

1. In-Source Tree: Modules present in the Linux Kernel Source Code

2. Out-of-Tree: Modules not present in the Linux Kernel Source Code.

All modules start out as "out-of-tree" developments, that can be compiled using the context of a source-tree. 

Once a module gets accepted to be included, it becomes an in-tree module.
