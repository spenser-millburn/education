#### Confidence Intervals for the Difference Between Two Means

Given:
- Sample size of new lightbulbs: $n_1 = 144$, sample mean: $\bar{X}_1 = 578$, sample standard deviation: $s_1 = 22$
- Sample size of old lightbulbs: $n_2 = 64$, sample mean: $\bar{X}_2 = 551$, sample standard deviation: $s_2 = 33$
- Confidence level: $95\%$

To find the confidence interval for the difference between the mean lifetimes of the two designs, we can use the formula:

$$
\left(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2\right) \pm Z \times \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
$$

where $Z$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level.

Here, we aim to find a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the mean lifetimes of the two types of lightbulbs.

#### Confidence Interval for \(\mu_X - \mu_Y\)

The distribution of \(X - Y\) can be determined using the Central Limit Theorem. 

- \(X\) follows a normal distribution with mean \(\mu_X\) and standard deviation \(\frac{\sigma_X}{\sqrt{144}\).
- \(Y\) follows a normal distribution with mean \(\mu_Y\) and standard deviation \(\frac{\sigma_Y}{\sqrt{64}\).

Since the samples are independent, the difference \(X - Y\) follows a normal distribution with mean \(\mu_X - \mu_Y\) and variance \(\sigma^2_{X-Y} = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{144} + \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{64}\).

The middle 95% of the curve for \(X - Y\) has a width of \(\pm 1.96\sigma_X\)

#### Population Standard Deviation Estimation

The population standard deviations \(\sigma_X\) and \(\sigma_Y\) are estimated using sample standard deviations \(s_X=22\) and \(s_Y=33\), respectively. 

\[
\sigma_{X−Y} \approx \sqrt{\frac{22^2}{144} + \frac{33^2}{64}} \approx 4.514
\]

#### Confidence Interval Calculation

The 95% confidence interval for \(\mu_X−\mu_Y\) is \(27 \pm 8.85\) when calculated using a normal distribution with mean \(\mu_X−\mu_Y\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{X−Y} = 4.514\). 

#### Two Sample Confidence Interval

If we have independent samples \(X_1, ..., X_n\) and \(Y_1, ..., Y_n\) from populations with means \(\mu_X, \mu_Y\) and standard deviations \(\sigma_X, \sigma_Y\) respectively, a confidence interval for \(\mu_X − \mu_Y\) can be calculated as:

\[
X−Y ± z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2_X}{n_X} + \sigma^2_Y}
\]

#### Concept: Calculation of Confidence Interval for Difference between Means

Given:
- $\bar{X}=88.5$, $s_X=49.4$ for 50 specimens at 50 cm depth
- $\bar{Y}=110.6$, $s_Y=51.5$ for 50 specimens at 250 cm depth
- Confidence level = 95%

We can calculate the confidence interval for the difference between the NO3 concentrations at the two depths using the formula:

$CI = (\bar{X} - \bar{Y}) \pm t_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y}}$

where:
- $n_X = n_Y = 50$ (number of specimens at each depth)
- $t_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical t-value for a 95% confidence interval with $(n_X + n_Y - 2)$ degrees of freedom

Now, substitute the given values and calculate the confidence interval for the difference between the NO3 concentrations at 50 cm and 250 cm depths.

#### Confidence Interval Calculation

Given:
- $\bar{X}=620$, $\bar{Y}=750$
- $sX=20$, $sY=30$
- $nX=nY=50$
- $z_{\alpha/2}=1.96$

The 95% confidence interval for the difference $\mu_Y - \mu_X$ is:
$$ (\bar{Y} - \bar{X}) \pm z_{\alpha/2} \times \sqrt{\frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y}} $$

Substitute in the values to get:
$$ 22.1 \pm 19.8 $$

#### Confidence Interval

The confidence interval for the difference in hardness between welds cooled at different rates can be calculated using the formula:

$$
CI = \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 \pm t_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
$$

#### Cooling Rate Effect

To determine if the cooling rate has an effect on hardness, we can compare the confidence intervals and check if they overlap. Non-overlapping confidence intervals would indicate a significant difference in hardness based on cooling rate.

#### Precision Increase

To increase the precision of the confidence interval the most, cooling all 10 welds at the rate of 30°C/s would be the best option. This is because reducing the variability in cooling rate results in a more precise estimate of the mean hardness.

#### Study on Sleep Habits
Given:
- Sample size ($n$) = 87
- Average time spent in bed ($\bar{x}$) = 7.70 hours
- Standard deviation ($\sigma$) = 1.02 hours
- Average time spent in bed asleep = 7.06 hours
- Standard deviation of time spent in bed asleep = 1.11 hours
- Mean time spent in bed awake = 7.70 - 7.06 = 0.64 hours

To compute a 95% confidence interval for the mean time spent in bed awake, we can use the confidence interval formula:
$$
\bar{x} \pm Z \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
$$

Where $Z$ is the critical value corresponding to the desired confidence level. Since the sample size is large (n > 30), we can use the Z-distribution critical value for 95% confidence, which is approximately 1.96.

Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the mean time spent in bed awake is:
$$
0.64 \pm 1.96 \left( \frac{1.02}{\sqrt{87}} \right)
$$

#### Confidence Intervals for the Difference Between Two Proportions

In a Bernoulli population, the mean success probability $p$ is the proportion of successes. When independent trials are performed from two Bernoulli populations, we can find a confidence interval for the difference between the two success probabilities. An example to illustrate this is below.

Given that 18 out of 60 light trucks from assembly line A had a defect, and 16 out of 90 from assembly line B had the defect. These can be treated as independent simple random samples from the population.

The 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean concentrations between alluvial and quaternary wells can be calculated using the formula:
$$
\text{CI}_{\text{diff}} = (\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) \pm t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
$$

where:
- $\bar{X}_1 = $ average concentration for alluvial wells
- $\bar{X}_2 = $ average concentration for quaternary wells
- $s_1 = 0.40$ (standard deviation for alluvial wells)
- $s_2 = 1.70$ (standard deviation for quaternary wells)
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes
- $t_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution with $\alpha = 0.05$

#### Two Proportions Confidence Interval

In a situation where we want to compare the proportions of two populations, we can calculate a confidence interval for the difference between these proportions.

The formula for the confidence interval for the difference between two proportions is:

$$\left(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2\right) \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1 - \hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1 - \hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$$

Where:
- $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$ are the sample proportions of the two populations.
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes of the two populations.
- $z^*$ is the critical value corresponding to the desired confidence level.

It's important to ensure that the samples are representative of the populations and that the sampling method doesn't introduce bias.
