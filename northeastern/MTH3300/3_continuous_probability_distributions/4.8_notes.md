# [4.8 Uniform Distribuiton]
#### Continuous Uniform Distribution
The continuous uniform distribution is characterized by being equally likely to take any value within a specific range. It is defined by two parameters:

- $a$: lower boundary of the distribution
- $b$: upper boundary of the distribution, where $a < b$

Uniform Distribution is extensively used in computer simulation studies where equal likelihood for all outcomes in a range is required.

#### Exponential Distribution as the Minimum of Independent Exponential Random Variables
If there are multiple light bulbs, each with a lifetime modeled by an independent exponential distribution with the same rate parameter $\lambda$, the time $T$ until the first bulb fails is also exponentially distributed. The key attributes are:
- **Rate parameter**: $\lambda_n = n \lambda$ where $n$ is the number of bulbs
- **Mean**: $E(T) = \frac{1}{n \lambda}$
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: $P(T \leq t) = 1 - e^{-n \lambda t}$

This distribution is crucial in reliability engineering and survival analysis.

#### Uniform Distribution

The **uniform distribution** is a type of probability distribution where every outcome is equally likely to occur within a given interval. The **probability density function (PDF)** of a continuous uniform distribution, defined between values $a$ and $b$, is denoted by:

$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{b-a} & \text{for } a < x < b \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

- **Notation**: If $X$ is a random variable described by this PDF, we say $X$ has a uniform distribution on the interval $(a, b)$, often written as $X \sim U(a, b)$.

- **Mean and Variance**: For a uniform distribution $U(a, b)$, the mean ($\mu_X$) and variance ($\sigma_X^2$) are given by:
  - Mean: $\mu_X = \frac{a+b}{2}$
  - Variance: $\sigma_X^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$ 

These expressions help summarize the central tendency and dispersion of a uniform distribution on a given interval.

#### Uniform Distribution Probability Calculation

For a random variable $X$ that follows a uniform distribution $U(a, b)$, the probability density function (pdf) is defined as:

$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{b-a} & \text{for } a \leq x \leq b \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

To find the probability that $X$ falls between two values $c$ and $d$ where $a \leq c < d \leq b$, you can use the formula:

$$
P(c < X < d) = \frac{d - c}{b - a}
$$

This formula calculates the area of the rectangle with height $\frac{1}{b-a}$ and width $(d-c)$, reflecting the constant nature of the probability density function across the interval from $a$ to $b$.

#### The Gamma Distribution
The gamma distribution is a continuous distribution that extends the exponential distribution for modeling waiting times.

- **Gamma Function**: This function is crucial in defining the gamma distribution. It is defined through an integral that extends over the positive real line and generalizes the factorial function to non-integer values.

#### Properties of the Gamma Function
- Integral Representation: $\Gamma(r) = \int_0^\infty e^{-t} t^{r-1} \, dt$
- Recursive Relation: $\Gamma(r+1) = r\Gamma(r)$
- Relation to Factorials: For a positive integer $n$, $\Gamma(n+1) = n!$

#### Application
The gamma distribution uses the gamma function in its probability density function, making it suitable for more complex scenarios of waiting times than what is described by the exponential distribution.

#### Gamma Function
- The gamma function, denoted as $\Gamma(r)$, is defined for $r > 0$ by the integral:
  $$
  \Gamma(r) = \int_0^\infty t^{r-1} e^{-t} dt
  $$
- It extends the factorial to non-integer arguments.
- Properties:
  1. $\Gamma(r) = (r-1)! \text{ for integer } r$
  2. $\Gamma(r + 1) = r\Gamma(r)$
  3. $\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\pi}$

#### Gamma Distribution
- The gamma distribution is defined by the probability density function (PDF):
  $$
  f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  \frac{\lambda^r x^{r-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{\Gamma(r)} & \text{if } x > 0 \\
  0 & \text{if } x \leq 0 
  \end{cases}
  $$
- Parameters: $r > 0$ and $\lambda > 0$.
- Notation: $X \sim \Gamma(r, \lambda)$.
- Relationship to Exponential Distribution: $\Gamma(1, \lambda) = \text{Exp}(\lambda)$.

#### Gamma Distribution as an Extension of the Exponential Distribution
When the parameter $r$ is an integer, the gamma distribution is a direct extension of the exponential distribution.

#### Relation to Poisson Process and Exponential Distribution
- If events follow a Poisson process with rate parameter $\lambda$, the time until the first event is distributed as $\text{Exp}(\lambda)$.
- If $r$ is any positive integer, the time until $r$ events have occurred follows a gamma distribution $\Gamma(r, \lambda)$.

#### Summation Property of Exponential Random Variables
- Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_r$ be the waiting times for the $1^{st}, 2^{nd}, \ldots, r^{th}$ event respectively, where each $X_i$ is independently and identically distributed as $\text{Exp}(\lambda)$.
- The total waiting time for $r$ events, $X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_r$, follows a $\Gamma(r, \lambda)$ distribution.

#### Gamma Random Variable

- **Mean and Variance**: 
  - If $X \sim \text{Gamma}(r, \lambda)$:
    - Mean ($\mu_X$): $ \mu_X = \frac{r}{\lambda} $
    - Variance ($\sigma^2_X$): $ \sigma^2_X = \frac{r}{\lambda^2} $

#### Poisson Distribution
- **Definition**: A distribution used to model the number of events within a fixed interval of time or space.
- **Notation**: $X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$
- **Mean**: $\lambda$
- **Probability of observing $x$ events**: $P(X=x) = e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}$

#### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for Poisson Distribution
- **CDF Calculation**: To find $P(X \geq k)$ where $X$ is Poisson distributed:
  $$
  P(X \geq k) = 1 - P(X < k) = 1 - \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^j}{j!}
  $$

#### Gamma Distribution
- **When Used**: Models the wait time until the $r$th event in a Poisson process.
- **Notation**: $T \sim \Gamma(r, \lambda)$ where $r$ is a positive integer.
- **CDF for Gamma Distribution**:
  $$
  F(x) = P(T \leq x) = \begin{cases} 
  1 - \sum_{j=0}^{r-1} e^{-\lambda x} \frac{(\lambda x)^j}{j!} & \text{if } x > 0 \\
  0 & \text{if } x \leq 0 
  \end{cases}
  $$
- **Erlang Distribution**: A special case of the gamma distribution where $r$ is a positive integer.
- **Chi-Square Distribution**: Special case when $r=k/2$ and $\lambda=1/2$, denoted as $\Gamma(\frac{k}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$.

#### The Weibull Distribution
The Weibull distribution is a continuous distribution used to model lifetimes of components. It is defined by two positive parameters, α (alpha) and β (beta), which determine its location and shape. The probability density function (pdf) for the Weibull distribution is given as:

$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
  \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha - 1} e^{-(x/\beta)^\alpha} & \text{for } x > 0 \\
  0 & \text{for } x \leq 0 
\end{cases}
$$

If $ X $ is a random variable with a Weibull distribution with parameters α and β, it is denoted by $ X \sim \text{Weibull}(\alpha, \beta) $. When α = 1, the Weibull distribution simplifies to the exponential distribution.

#### Weibull Distribution

- **Equivalence to Exponential Distribution**: The Weibull distribution with parameters $\alpha = 1$ and $\beta$ is equivalent to the exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda = \beta$. 
  - Notation: $\text{Weibull}(1,\beta) = \text{Exp}(\beta)$.

- **Flexibility**: The Weibull distribution is capable of generating a wide variety of shapes by varying its parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This allows it to fit a range of data sets, providing broad applicability.

- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: Different settings of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ lead to different forms of the Weibull PDF, which describes the likelihood of different outcomes.

- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: The Weibull CDF, which provides the probability that a random variable $X$ is less than or equal to a value $x$, can be calculated by:
  - $F(x) = P(X \leq x) = \begin{cases} 
    1 - e^{-(\beta x)^\alpha} & x > 0 \\
    0 & x \leq 0 
  \end{cases}$

- **Computation Tip for CDF**: To compute the integral for the CDF, use the substitution $u = (\beta t)^\alpha$ and $du = \alpha \beta^\alpha t^{\alpha-1} dt$.

#### Weibull Distribution Mean and Variance

The mean $(\mu_X)$ and variance $(\sigma^2_X)$ of the Weibull distribution, where $X \sim \text{Weibull}(\alpha, \beta)$, can be described using the gamma function $(\Gamma)$ as follows:

- **Mean of Weibull Distribution**:
  $$
  \mu_X = \frac{1}{\beta} \Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{\alpha}\right)
  $$

- **Variance of Weibull Distribution**:
  $$
  \sigma^2_X = \frac{1}{\beta^2} \left(\Gamma\left(1 + \frac{2}{\alpha}\right) - \left(\Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{\alpha}\right)\right)^2\right)
  $$

#### Special Cases

1. **When $1/\alpha$ is an integer:**
   - **Mean**:
     $$
     \mu_X = \frac{1}{\beta} \left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)!
     $$
   - **Variance**:
     $$
     \sigma^2_X = \frac{1}{\beta^2} \left(\left(\frac{2}{\alpha}\right)! - \left(\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)!\right)^2\right)
     $$

2. **When $1/\alpha$ is of the form $n/2$ where $n$ is an integer:**
   - The mean and variance can be computed exactly through repeated applications of Properties 2 and 3 of the gamma function.

3. **For other values of $\alpha$:**
   - The mean and variance must be approximated.

#### Weibull Distribution

The Weibull distribution is a flexible probability distribution that can model various types of data. The probability density function and cumulative distribution function are used to describe its behavior and to calculate probabilities associated with the distribution.

- **Parameters**: The Weibull distribution typically has two parameters, $ \alpha $ (shape parameter) and $ \beta $ (scale parameter).

- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:
  
  The cumulative distribution function for the Weibulldistribution can be expressed as:
  $
  P(T \leq t) = 1 - e^{-(\frac{t}{\beta})^\alpha}
  $

  This function provides the probability that a random variable $ T $ which follows a Weibull distribution is less than or equal to a particular value $ t $.

- **Important Probabilities**:

  - **Probability of exceeding a specific value**: $ P(T > t) $ can be calculated as:
    
    $
    P(T > t) = 1 - P(T \leq t)
    $

  - **Probability between two values**: The probability that $ T $ falls between two values $ a $ and $ b $ ($ a < b $) can be found using:
    
    $
    P(a < T < b) = P(T \leq b) - P(T \leq a)
    $

These properties of the Weibull distribution are essential when modeling times such as the life of an item, or in this context, the duration of a bake step in semiconductor manufacturing.

#### Exponential Distribution

This concept describes the probability of an event in a specific time period, defined by the formula for the exponential distribution:

$$ P(T \leq t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t} $$

where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter of the exponential distribution. 

#### Calculating Probability Between Two Points

The probability that variable $T$ falls within a specified interval $[a, b]$ when $T$ follows an exponential distribution can be determined by:

$$ P(a \leq T \leq b) = P(T \leq b) - P(T \leq a) = (1 - e^{-\lambda b}) - (1 - e^{-\lambda a}) = e^{-\lambda a} - e^{-\lambda b} $$

#### Example Calculation

Given $\lambda = 0.1$, the probability that $T$ is between 2 and 7 is:

$$ P(2 \leq T \leq 7) = e^{-0.2 \cdot 0.3} - e^{-0.7 \cdot 0.3} = e^{-0.06} - e^{-0.21} \approx 0.132 $$

#### Key Concepts in Probability and Statistics

- **Gamma Distribution**: 
  - Notation: $T \sim \Gamma(r, \lambda)$
  - Mean: $\mu_T = \frac{r}{\lambda}$
  - Variance: $\sigma^2_T = \frac{r}{\lambda^2}$
  - To solve for parameters $r$ and $\lambda$ given mean $\mu_T$ and variance $\sigma^2_T$:
    $$
    r = \frac{\mu_T^2}{\sigma^2_T}, \quad \lambda = \frac{\mu_T}{\sigma^2_T}
    $$

- **Exponential Distribution**:
  - Key Property: Memorylessness
  - Parameter: Rate $\lambda$
  - Mean: $\frac{1}{\lambda}$
  - Variance: $\frac{1}{\lambda^2}$
  - Example Application: Lifetimes of components

- **Weibull Distribution**:
  - Notation: $T \sim \text{Weibull}(k, \lambda)$
  - Parameters: Shape $k$, Scale $\lambda$
  - Mean and variance for $k$ and $\lambda$:
    $$
    \mu_T = \lambda \Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right),
    \sigma^2_T = \lambda^2 \left[\Gamma\left(1 + \frac{2}{k}\right) - \left(\Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right)\right)^2\right]
    $$
  - Commonly used for reliability analysis and survival analysis.

- **Hazard Function**:
  - Definition:
    $$
    h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{1 - F(t)}
    $$
  - Used to describe the failure rate of an item, considering the probability of failure at a specific time interval given that it has not yet failed.

These concepts are integral to understanding various advanced topics in statistics and probability models, particularly in areas such as reliability engineering and life data analysis.

#### Weibull Distribution and Hazard Function
The Weibull distribution, denoted as $T \sim \text{Weibull}(\alpha, \beta)$, has a hazard function (or hazard rate) $h(t)$ given by:

$$ h(t) = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \left( \frac{t}{\beta} \right)^{\alpha - 1} $$

#### Hazard Function Behavior
- The hazard rate is **increasing** over time when $\alpha > 1$.
- The hazard rate is **decreasing** over time when $\alpha < 1$.
- The hazard rate is **constant** when $\alpha = 1$.

#### Exponential Distribution and Hazard Function
If the random variable $T$ has an exponential distribution, the hazard function $h(t)$ is constant. This is shown by the characteristic of the exponential distribution where $\alpha = 1$ in a Weibull distribution context, making $h(t)$ simplify to a constant value:

$$ h(t) = \frac{1}{\beta} $$
