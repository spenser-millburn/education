# [ 4.5 - Normal Distribution ] 

#### Normal Distribution

#### Normal Distribution

- **Mean and Variance:** If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then the mean $\mu_X$ and variance $\sigma_X^2$ of $X$ are:
  - $\mu_X = \mu$
  - $\sigma_X^2 = \sigma^2$

- **Probability Density Function (PDF):**
  - The normal probability density function is symmetric around the mean $\mu$.
  $$
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  $$
  - $\mu$ is both the median and the mean of the distribution.

- **Standard Deviations and Data Coverage:**
  - Approximately 68% of the data is within $\mu \pm \sigma$.
  - Approximately 95% of the data is within $\mu \pm 2\sigma$.
  - Approximately 99.7% of the data is within $\mu \pm 3\sigma$.

- **Standard Units Conversion:**
  - Standard units are used to describe how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean.
  - This conversion allows for easy comparison between different normal distributions.

#### Normal Distribution
The normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetrical about the mean $\mu$. It describes how data values are dispersed or spread in a dataset.

#### Standard Units
To convert an observation to standard units (also known as z-scores), subtract the mean $\mu$ from the observation and divide the result by the standard deviation $\sigma$. The formula to convert a value $x$ into standard units is:

$$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} $$

Where:
- $x$ is the observation,
- $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution,
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution.

The standard units represent how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean.

#### Z-Score
The z-score (or standard score) of an item \( x \) from a normal distribution with mean \( \mu \) and variance \( \sigma^2 \) is calculated as:

$$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} $$

This transforms \( x \) into the standard unit equivalent \( z \), which comes from a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This distribution is called the standard normal population.

#### Proportions in a Normal Population

The proportion of a normal population that falls within a given interval can be determined by the area under the normal probability density function (PDF) for that interval. This area represents the probability of a variable falling within the interval.

#### Calculation of Area Under Normal Curve

- The area under the normal curve, necessary for finding the probabilities, cannot be routinely calculated using elementary calculus (e.g., antiderivatives).
- Instead, the area must be estimated numerically because the antiderivative of the normal PDF involves an infinite series.

#### Use of Standard Normal Table

- For practical purposes, areas under the standard normal curve (mean = 0, variance = 1) are often utilized. These values are tabulated in standard normal tables (often called Z-tables). 
- These tables provide a convenient method to approximate the area under the curve, facilitating the calculation of probabilities for standard normal distributions. 

These tables and concepts are fundamental in statistics, particularly in hypothesis testing and in determining probabilities involving normal distributions.

#### Commonly Used Distributions

- The total area under the normal distribution curve is equal to $1$.
- Areas in the left-hand tail of the curve for values of $z$ can be found using a $z$-table. 
- To find areas to the right of a specific $z$-value, subtract the table value from $1$. 
- To find the area between two $z$-values, subtract the area to the left of the lower $z$-value from the area to the left of the higher $z$-value.

#### 4.5 The Normal Distribution

- **Normal Distribution**: A very important statistical distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve.
  
- **Z-scores**: Standard scores that represent the number of standard deviations an element is from the mean. A $Z$-score of $0$ corresponds to the mean.

- **Percentiles and Z-scores**:
  - $75^{th}$ percentile corresponds approximately to $Z = 0.67$.
  - $25^{th}$ percentile corresponds to $Z = -0.67$.
  - The median corresponds to $Z = 0$.

- **Symmetry in the Normal Distribution**: Due to its symmetric property, the $25^{th}$ percentile is simply the negative of the $75^{th}$ percentile in a standard normal distribution.


#### Normal Distribution and Standardization

- **Normal Distribution:** A random variable \(X\) is distributed normally with a mean (\(\mu\)) and a standard deviation (\(\sigma\)). This is denoted as \(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)\).

- **Standardization of a Normal Variable:** To standardize a normal variable \(X\), use the transformation:
  \[
  Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
  \]
  where \(Z\) will have a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

- **Finding Probabilities:** The probability of \(X\) falling between two values \(a\) and \(b\) is found by transforming these limits to the standard normal scale and then calculating the area under the curve:
  \[
  P(a < X < b) = P\left(\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma} < Z < \frac{b - \mu}{\sigma}\right)
  \]

- **Utilizing the Standard Normal Table (Z-table):** This table provides the probabilities for values less than a given \(Z\)-score within the standard normal distribution. To find \(P(a < X < b)\), use:
  \[
  P(a < X < b) = P(Z < \frac{b - \mu}{\sigma}) - P(Z < \frac{a - \mu}{\sigma})
  \]

#### Concepts: Normal Distribution and Percentiles

1. **Definition of Normal Distribution**:
   The normal distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.

2. **Percentiles in Normal Distribution**:
   Percentiles describe the position of a value within a distribution, indicating that a certain percentage of the data falls below that value. For example, the 40th percentile is the value below which 40% of the data may be found.

3. **Z-Score**:
   The Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. 

   If $X$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, then the Z-score of a value $x$ is given by:
   $$
   Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
   $$

4. **Calculating Percentiles**:
   To identify the 40th percentile or any other percentile of a normally distributed variable:
   - Find the corresponding z-score that reflects the percentile using normal distribution tables or software.
   - Convert the z-score back to the raw data scale using the formula: 
   $$
   x = \mu + Z \sigma
   $$
   where $x$ is the value at the desired percentile, $\mu$ is the mean, $Z$ is the z-score, and $\sigma$ is the standard  deviation.
  
   This approach adjusts the mean score by the variability in the data, scaled by how unusual (or typical) the percentile's Z-score is.

5. **Example Calculation**:
   - For a population with mean ($\mu$) 50 and standard deviation ($\sigma$) 5, the 40th percentile corresponds to a Z-score of approximately -0.25. The value of the 40th percentile, $x$, is then calculated as follows:
   $$
   x = 50 + (-0.25 \times 5) = 48.75
   $$
   Thus, 40% of the population has a battery lifetime of 48.75 hours or lower.

#### The Normal Distribution

- **Z-Scores**: To find the proportion of values within a specific interval under the normal distribution, transform the variable \(X\) using the z-score formula:
  \[
  z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
  \]
  where:
  - \(X\) is the value of interest
  - \(\mu\) is the mean of the distribution
  - \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of the distribution.

- **Calculating Probabilities**: The probability that \(X\) falls between two values is found by calculating the z-scores for these two values and referencing the standard normal distribution:
  \[
  P(a < X < b) = P(z_a < Z < z_b)
  \]
  where \(z_a\) and \(z_b\) are the z-scores corresponding to the values \(a\) and \(b\), respectively. The area under the normal distribution between these z-scores gives the required probability.

- **Example Insight**: If the mean of the distribution is adjusted to perfectly align with the midpoint of the desired interval, and the standard deviation remains constant, the proportion of values falling within the interval can be increased, making the distribution more centered around key targets.

#### Linear Functions of Normal Random Variables

- If $X$ is a normal random variable, any linear transformation of $X$ also follows a normal distribution. For a linear transformation $Y = aX + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants:
  - The mean of $Y$ is $E(Y) = a\mu + b$.
  - The variance of $Y$ is $\operatorname{Var}(Y) = a^2\sigma^2$.

#### Transformation of Normal Random Variables

If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, and $a \neq 0$ and $b$ are constants, then the random variable $Y = aX + b$ also follows a normal distribution:

$$
Y \sim N(a\mu + b, a^2\sigma^2)
$$

#### Linear Combinations of Independent Normal Random Variables

When combining independent normal random variables linearly, the resulting random variable remains normally distributed.

#### Linear Combination of Normal Random Variables

- **Independent Normal Random Variables**: Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ be independent normal random variables where $X_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma_i^2)$.
- **Constants**: Let $c_1, c_2, ..., c_n$ be constants.
- **Linear Combination**: The linear combination $c_1X_1 + c_2X_2 + ... + c_nX_n$ is also a normally distributed random variable.
  
- **Mean of the Linear Combination**: The mean is given by $c_1\mu_1 + c_2\mu_2 + ... + c_n\mu_n$.
- **Variance of the Linear Combination**: The variance is given by $c_1^2\sigma_1^2 + c_2^2\sigma_2^2 + ... + c_n^2\sigma_n^2$.

The resultant distribution is:
$$
c_1X_1 + c_2X_2 + ... + c_nX_n \sim N(c_1\mu_1 + c_2\mu_2 + ... + c_n\mu_n, c_1^2\sigma_1^2 + c_2^2\sigma_2^2 + ... + c_n^2\sigma_n^2)
$$

#### Oxygen Equivalence Equation

To estimate properties such as strength, ductility, and hardness in welds of nearly pure titanium, the oxygen equivalence equation is used:

$$ E = 2C + 3.5N + O $$

- $E$: Oxygen equivalence
- $C$: Carbon content in ppm (parts per million)
- $N$: Nitrogen content in ppm
- $O$: Oxygen content in ppm

#### Distribution of $E$

Given that $C$, $N$, and $O$ are independent and normally distributed:
- $\mu_C = 150, \mu_N = 200, \mu_O = 1500$
- $\sigma_C = 30, \sigma_N = 60, \sigma_O = 100$

The variable $E$ is a linear combination of these independent normal variables, hence $E$ itself is normally distributed with mean ($\mu_E$) and variance ($\sigma^2_E$):

- $\mu_E = 2\mu_C + 3.5\mu_N + \mu_O = 2(150) + 3.5(200) + 1500 = 2500$
- $\sigma^2_E = 4\sigma^2_C + 12.25\sigma^2_N + \sigma^2_O = 4(900) + 12.25(3600) + 10000 = 2500$

Thus, the distribution of $E$ is normal $\mathcal{N}(2500, \sigma^2_E)$.

#### Normal Distribution of Sample Mean
When $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ is a random sample from a population with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ has:
- Mean: $\mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu$
- Variance: $\sigma^2_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$
- If the population is normal, $\bar{X}$ is also normally distributed, i.e., $\bar{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)$.

#### Linear Combinations of Independent Normal Random Variables
For independent normal random variables $X$ and $Y$:
- The sum $X+Y$ and the difference $X-Y$ are linear combinations.
- Their distributions can be computed as $X+Y \sim N(\mu_X + \mu_Y, \sigma^2_X + \sigma^2_Y)$ and $X-Y \sim N(\mu_X - \mu_Y, \sigma^2_X + \sigma^2_Y)$.

#### Example Statistical Calculation
- To find $P(E > 3000)$ for $E \sim N(2500, 57700)$, compute the z-score $z = \frac{3000 - 2500}{\sqrt{57700}} = 2.08$, leading to $P(E > 3000) = 0.0188$.

#### Summary of Normal Distribution Properties

- **Sum of Independent Normal Variables**: 
  If $X$ and $Y$ are independent normal random variables such that $X \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2)$ and $Y \sim N(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y^2)$, the sum $X+Y$ is also a normal variable:
  \[
  X+Y \sim N(\mu_X+\mu_Y, \sigma_X^2+\sigma_Y^2)
  \]

- **Difference of Independent Normal Variables**:
  The difference $X-Y$ is also a normal variable with parameters:
  \[
  X-Y \sim N(\mu_X-\muY, \sigma_X^2+\sigma_Y^2)
  \]

#### Determining Normality from Sample Data

- **Large Samples**:
  For significantly large samples, the histogram of the sample data can resemble the normal density distribution, often showing a central peak with symmetric decrease on both sides.

- **Probability Plots**:
  Probability plots are effective for assessing normality in large samples. These plots compare the distribution of the sample data to a theoretical normal distribution.

- **Small Samples**:
  Determining normality from small samples is challenging.

#### Normal Distribution and Outliers
- Normal distributions contain few, if any, outliers.
- Not suitable for small data sets with outliers or unknown distributions.

#### Derivation of Mean and Variance for Normal Distribution
- For $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, the mean $\mu_X = \mu$ and variance $\sigma_X^2 = \sigma^2$.
- Using substitution $z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$, the mean and variance can be computed confirming that $\mu_X$ and $\sigma_X^2$ are equivalent to $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ respectively.

#### Important Concepts

- The integral of the standard normal distribution (N(0,1)) probability density function over all possible values equals 1:
  $$
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2} \, dz = 1
  $$

- To find the expected value \(\mu_X\) of a normal distribution, consider \(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)\). This results in:
  $$
  \mu_X = \sigma(0) + \mu(1) = \mu
  $$

- To find the variance \(\sigma^2_X\) of \(X\), utilize the equation:
  $$
  \sigma^2_X = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x - \mu_X)^2 \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2} \,dx
  $$
  With substitution \(z = \frac{(x-\mu)}{\sigma}\), and knowing \(\mu_X = \mu\), we have:
  $$
  \sigma^2_X = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \sigma^2 z^2 \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \sigma e^{-z^2/2} \, dz = \sigma^2 \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} z^2 e^{-z^2/2} \, dz
  $$
  Integrating by parts twice reveals:
  $$
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} z^2 e^{-z^2/2} \, dz = 1
  $$
  Therefore:
  $$
  \sigma^2_X = \sigma^2
  $$

#### Normal Distribution
The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.

- **Mean ($\mu$)**: Average of all data points.
- **Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)**: Measures the dispersion or variability of the data set.

#### Properties of Normal Distribution
- The total area under the normal distribution curve is equal to 1.
- It is symmetric about the mean, with the shape of the curve often referred to as bell-shaped.

#### Standard Normal Distribution
A standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of zero ($\mu = 0$) and a standard deviation of one ($\sigma = 1$). Any normal distribution can be transformed into a standard normal distribution using the following formula:
$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$
where $X$ is a value from the original distribution, $\mu$ is the mean of the original distribution, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the original distribution, and $Z$ is the corresponding value in the standard normal distribution.

#### Normal Distribution Calculations
- **Probability of X being greater than a certain value** ($P(X > x)$), less than a certain value ($P(X < x)$), or between two values ($P(a < X < b)$) can be computed using the standard normal distribution.

- **Z-score** is a measure that describes the position of a raw score in terms of its distance from the mean, measured in standard deviations.

- **Percentiles** in a normal distribution indicate the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls.

Each of the assessments in the problems provided, for both distribution specific parameters and general observations, can be computed using these central concepts and formulas.

#### Normal Distribution Basics
- **Normal Distribution**: A probability distribution characterized by a bell-shaped curve, symmetrical about the mean.
- **Notation**: Normally distributed variable $X$ with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is denoted as $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$.

#### Calculating Probabilities
- **Standardization**: Convert a normal variable $X$ to the standard normal variable $Z$ using $Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$.
- **Standard Normal Distribution**: Has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, denoted as $Z \sim N(0,1)$.
  
#### Percentiles and Scores
- **Percentile**: Indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations fall. 
- **Calculating a Value from a Percentile**: Use the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), often denoted as $\Phi^{-1}(p)$, where $p$ is the percentile in decimal form.

#### Specific Values and Operations
- **Finding the \(k\)th percentile of \(X\)**: Use the formula $X_k = \mu + \sigma \cdot \Phi^{-1}(p)$.
- **Probability of \(X\) being greater than a specific value**: Use $P(X > x) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)$.
- **Probability between two values**: If interested in $P(a < X < b)$, compute as $\Phi\left(\frac{b - \mu}{\sigma}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma}\right)$. 

#### Applications in Questions
1. **For any Normal Distribution Example \(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)\)**:
    - **Above a Value**: Compute $P(X > a) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma}\right)$.
    - **Between Values**: Compute $P(a < X < b) = \Phi\left(\frac{b - \mu}{\sigma}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma}\right)$.
    - **Percentile Value**: If needing the value at the `q` percentile, use $X_q = \mu + \sigma \cdot \Phi^{-1}(q)$.

#### Probability Concepts

1. **Probability Distribution Concepts**
   - **Normal Distribution**: A crucial probability distribution in statistics often used for natural and measurement phenomena.
   - **Percentile Score**: Indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations fall.
   - **Probability Calculations**:
     - For a normally distributed variable, probabilities can be calculated using the variable's $ Z $-score, which standardizes any given value using the mean and standard deviation of the distribution.

2. **Considering Real-World Data Limitations**
   - **Truncated Data in Normal Distribution**: The presence of an upper limit (like a maximum possible SAT score) suggests that the distribution may be truncated normal rather than strictly normal.

3. **Statistical Measurements in Industrial Processes**
   - **Control Limits in Production**: Highlighting the importance of control limits (like optimum sugar concentration in broth) in maintaining the efficiency of industrial processes. 

#### Real World Application of Statistics

- **Implication of Deviation from Normal Distribution**: Addresses the complications in statistical modeling if real-world data deviates from the expected normal distribution (e.g., SAT scores) due to practical constraints such as maximum and minimum limits. 

- **Risk Management in Production**: Evaluating risk (e.g., the probability that sugar concentration exceeds a certain threshold causing shutdown) is critical in industries for economic efficiency and operational stability. These risk calculations often assume normality for the underlying data distribution.

#### Normal Distribution
Normal distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution, is characterized by its bell-shaped curve, symmetric about the mean. It is fully described by its mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) parameters. The formula for the probability density function of a normal distribution is:

$$ f(x | \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$

#### Properties of Normal Distribution
1. **Symmetry About the Mean:** The distribution is symmetric around its mean, with data points distributed in a pattern such that half of the values are on each side of the mean.
2. **68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule):** About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.
3. **Standard Normal Distribution:** A special case of the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is often referred to as the Z-distribution.

#### Calculating Properties of a Normally Distributed Variable

- **Finding Mean ($\mu$) and Standard Deviation ($\sigma$):**
  If you know certain percentiles and the corresponding values from a dataset, you can use the properties of the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) along with Z-tables to find $\mu$ and $\sigma$.

- **Using Z-Scores:**
  A Z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. 
  $$ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} $$
  where $X$ is the value from the dataset.

- **Calculating Probabilities:**
  To find the probability that a normally distributed variable falls within a certain range, integrate the probability density function or use Z-scores in conjunction with the Z-table.

#### Specific Applications
1. **Quality Control and Specifications:**
   When dealing with specifications such as the minimum necessary tensile strength for bolts, normal distribution can help in determining compliance rates and the potential need for adjustments in manufacturing processes.

2. **Engineering Tolerances:**
   Understanding the distribution of component sizes (like the diameter of holes and pistons in an engine), which often follow normal distributions due to natural variability in manufacturing, is crucial in engineering for fit, form, and function. 

These concepts form the basis for many applications in statistics, engineering, economics, and business for analyzing and making decisions based on data variability and distribution.

#### Normal Distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.

#### Mean and Standard Deviation

- **Mean (\(\mu\))** is the average of all the values.
- **Standard Deviation (\(\sigma\))** measures the amount of variation or dispersion from the average.

#### Calculating Mean Clearance

Given a normal distribution of a variable (\(X\)), the mean clearance can be calculated directly from the provided mean of the distribution. If the provided data or distribution parameters include a mean (\(\mu\)), that value directly represents the mean clearance.

In this particular case, if the shaft diameter \(X\) has a mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\), the mean clearance is directly calculated as:

$$
\text{Mean Clearance} = \mu
$$

Make sure you substitute the correct value of \(\mu\) given in the problem or scenario.
