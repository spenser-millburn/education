## [6.1] 2, 6, 10 

### Problem 2 
```
2. A simple random sample consists of 65 lengths of pi-
ano wire that were tested for the amount of extension
under a load of 30 N. The average extension for the
65 lines was 1.102 mm and the standard deviation was
0.020 mm. Let μ represent the mean extension for all
specimens of this type of piano wire.
```
```
a. Find the P-value for testing H0 : μ ≤ 1.1 versus
H1 : μ > 1.1.
```
n = 65 lines

$\sigma{\bar{x}} = 0.020 mm$

$\bar{x} = 1.102mm$

$F = 30N$

---- 

compute z-score

$$
z =  \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma{\bar{x}}} =  \frac{1.102 - 1.1}{\frac{0.020}{\sqrt{65}}} = 0.80622\\
norm.s.dist(z) =
