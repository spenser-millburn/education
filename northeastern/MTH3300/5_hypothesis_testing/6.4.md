#### Steps in Performing a Hypothesis Test

1. Define $H_0$ and $H_1$.
2. Assume $H_0$ to be true.
3. Compute a test statistic.
4. Compute the P-value of the test statistic.
5. State a conclusion about the strength of the evidence against $H_0$.

#### Another Way to Express $H_0$

When assuming $H_0$ to be true, the value closest to $H_1$ is used. Some authors consider this single value to be $H_0$, so that $H_0: \mu = 100$ instead of $H_0: \mu \geq 100. This notation clarifies which value is used when $H_0$ is assumed to be true.

#### Interpretation Disadvantage

When testing hypotheses, the value closest to $H_1$ may not be of special interest. We are typically concerned with values beyond a certain threshold, not just a specific value. For instance, in the given emissions example, the concern is not solely $\mu = 100$, but rather $\mu \geq 100$. Hence, we often express the null hypothesis as $H_0: \mu \geq 100$.

#### Example 6.1

An experiment on wear in boundary lubrication involved 45 steel balls lubricated with puriﬁed parafﬁn. The average wear was 673.2 μm with a standard deviation of 14.9 μm. The objective is to test $H_0: \mu \geq 675$ against $H_1: \mu < 675$.

For this scenario, we need to find the P-value for the hypothesis test.

#### Statistical Language Translation

1. **Given Data**:
   - Sample Size: $n=45$
   - Sample Mean: $\bar{X}=673.2$
   - Sample Standard Deviation: $s=14.9$
   - Population Mean: $\mu$ (unknown)

2. **Basic Issue**:
   - Uncertainty in the sample mean affects conclusions.
   - If no uncertainty, the lubricant meets spec ($673.2<675$).
   
3. **Hypothesis Testing Steps**:
   - 1. **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: Lubricant does not meet spec.
   - 2. **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: Lubricant...

#### Sample and Population Statistics

- The sample was drawn from a population with mean $\mu = 675$ and estimated population standard deviation $\sigma$ with the sample standard deviation $s = 14.9$.
- Under the null hypothesis $H_{0}$, the test is based on $X$ from a normal population with mean 675 and standard deviation $\frac{14.9}{\sqrt{45}} = 2.22$.

#### Test Statistics

- The test statistic is the z-score, calculated as $z = \frac{673.2 - 675}{2.22} = -0.81$.
- The P-value is 0.209, indicating a 20.9% chance of observing a sample mean less than or equal to 673.2.

#### Inference

- As the P-value is not very small (0.209), we do not reject $H_{0}$.
- Consequently, we conclude that $H_{0}$ is plausible but not necessarily true.
- The data do not conclusively show that the lubricant meets the specification.

#### Null Distribution of \( X \) and P-Value
- \( z = \frac{673.2 - 675}{2.221} = -0.81 \)
- \( P = 0.209 \)
- If \( H_0 \) is true, the probability of observing a value as extreme as or more extreme than 673.2 is 0.209, which is the P-value.

#### MINITAB Output for Example 6.1
- One-Sample Z Test for Wear Data
- \( \mu = 675 \) vs. \( \mu < 675 \)
- Assumed standard deviation = 14.9
- 95% Upper Confidence Bound for \( \mu \): 676.853
- The null hypothesis is stated as \( \mu = 675 \) to construct the null distribution.
- "SE Mean" is the standard deviation of \( X \), estimated by \( \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \).

#### Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis

In some cases, a null hypothesis specifies that the population mean is equal to a specific value. Example $6.2$ provides an illustration.

#### Example 6.2: Scale Calibration

A scale is to be calibrated by weighing a $1000 g$ test weight $60$ times. The $60$ scale readings have mean $1000.6 g$ and standard deviation $2 g$. Find the P-value for testing $H_{0}: \mu = 1000$ versus $H_{1}: \mu \neq 1000$.

#### Solution

Let $\mu$ denote the population mean reading. The null hypothesis states that the scale is in calibration, where the population mean $\mu$ is equal to the true weight of $1000 g$, and any difference is due to chance. The alternative hypothesis suggests that the scale is out of calibration.

In this example, the null hypothesis specifies that $\mu$ is equal to a specific value rather than greater than or equal to or less than or equal to. For this reason, values of $X$ that are either much larger or much smaller than $\mu$ will provide evidence against $H_{0}$.

#### Null Distribution of X
- Given: $\mu=1000$, $s=2$, $\sigma=\frac{2}{\sqrt{60}}=0.258$
- Null distribution of X: mean=1000, standard deviation=0.258

#### Z-Score Calculation
- $z= \frac{1000.6 - 1000}{0.258} = 2.32$

#### P-Value Calculation
- P-value is the sum of areas in both tails of the curve
- P-value = 0.0204

#### Decision
- The evidence against $H_0$ is strong
- Probability of a result as extreme as observed is 0.0204
- It is prudent to reject $H_0$ and recalibrate the scale

#### Large-Sample Tests for a Population Mean

When $H_0$ specifies a single value for $\mu$, both tails contribute to the P-value in a two-sided or two-tailed test. 

When $H_0$ specifies only that $\mu$ is greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to a value, only one tail contributes to the P-value in a one-sided or one-tailed test.

#### Summary

- Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ be a large (e.g., $n>30$) sample from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.
- To test a null hypothesis of the form $H_0: \mu \leq \mu_0$, $H_0: \mu \geq \mu_0$, or $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$:
  - Compute the z-score: $z = \frac{X - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$. If $\sigma$ is unknown, it may be approximated with $s$.
  - Compute the P-value. The P-value is an area under the normal curve.

#### Hypothesis Testing Concepts

1. **Alternate Hypothesis & P-value**:
   - $H_1: \mu > \mu_0$: Area to the right of z.
   - $H_1: \mu < \mu_0$: Area to the left of z.
   - $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$: Sum of the areas in the tails cut off by z and $-z$.

#### Exercises for Section 6.1

1. **Experiment on Lifetime of Parts**:
   - Given: Mean = 783, Standard Deviation = 120.
   - Hypotheses: $H_0: \mu \leq 750$ vs. $H_1: \mu > 750$.
   - Find: P-value.
   - Conclusion: Mean is greater than 750 or falls in the most extreme % of its distribution.

2. **Random Sample of Piano Wire**:
   - Given: Sample size = 65, Mean extension = 1.102 mm, Standard Deviation = 0.020 mm.
   - Let $\mu$ represent the mean extension.

#### 1. Find the P-value for testing H0: μ ≤ 1.1 versus H1: μ > 1.1

The P-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

The test statistic is calculated based on the sample mean, population mean, standard deviation, and sample size.

$H_0: \mu \leq 1.1$ versus $H_1: \mu > 1.1$

#### 2. Either the mean extension for this type of wire is greater than 1.1 mm, or the sample is in the most extreme p% of its distribution.

This statement suggests a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis states that the mean extension is less than or equal to 1.1 mm, and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean extension is greater than 1.1 mm.

#### 3. Find the P-value for testing H0: μ = 232 versus H1: μ ≠ 232

In hypothesis testing, the P-value represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true.

Given the population mean voltage for the industrial networks and the sample statistics, we can compute the P-value.

$H_0: \mu = 232$ versus $H_1: \mu \neq 232$

#### 4. Either the mean voltage is not equal to 232, or the sample is in the most extreme p% of its distribution.

This proposition implies a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis states that the mean voltage is equal to 232 V, and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean voltage is not equal to 232 V.
