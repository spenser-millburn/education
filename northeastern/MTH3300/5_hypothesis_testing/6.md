#### Large-Sample Tests for a Population Mean

$H_0: \mu = 100$  
$H_1: \mu < 100$  

The sample mean is 92 mg/s. We want to determine if this sample could have come from a population with a mean of 100 mg/s or more. We will conduct a hypothesis test to address this concern.

#### Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) 
The population mean is greater than or equal to 100, and the sample mean is lower due to random variation. This suggests emissions will not decrease with the new design.

#### Alternate Hypothesis ($H_1$) 
The population mean is less than 100, and the sample mean reflects this difference. This indicates a real effect that can be expected with the new design.

#### Hypothesis Testing Basics

In hypothesis testing, we compare the null hypothesis $H_0$ with an alternative hypothesis $H_1$. For example:
$H_0: \mu \geq 100$ vs. $H_1: \mu < 100$

#### P-Value and Evidence

After conducting a hypothesis test, we obtain a P-value that quantifies the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A smaller P-value indicates stronger evidence against $H_0$.

#### Null Hypothesis (H0)

$H_0$: The population mean is 100 or more.

#### Rejecting the Null Hypothesis

If the P-value is sufficiently small, we may reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis $H_1$.

#### Steps for Hypothesis Testing

1. Compute the null distribution of the sample mean $X$ under the assumption that $H_0$ is true.

2. Compute the P-value, which is the probability under $H_0$ of observing a value of $X$ as extreme as or more extreme than the one obtained from the sample.

#### Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem states that the sample mean of a large sample comes from a normal distribution with mean μ and variance σ^2/50, where σ^2 is the population variance and 50 is the sample size. This means that for a sample size of 50, the mean follows a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ/√50.

#### Null Distribution under H0

Assuming H0 is true with μ ≥ 100, we take μ = 100 as the assumed value. Given a large sample size, we approximate the population standard deviation σ with the sample standard deviation s = 21. Therefore, under H0, X follows a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 2.97, resulting in X ~ N(100, 2.972).

#### Step 2: Hypothesis Testing

After determining the null distribution, we proceed with step 2 of hypothesis testing.

#### Normal Distribution

$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$

#### P-Value Calculation

P-value is the probability that a number drawn from the null distribution would disagree with $H_0$ at least as strongly as the observed value of $X$, which is 92. 

P-value = $P(X \leq 92 | X \sim N(100, 2.972))$

#### Z-Score Calculation

$z = \frac{92 - 100}{2.97} = -2.69$

#### P-Value Interpretation

The P-value of 0.0036 indicates that it is unlikely to observe a value as extreme as 92 given the null hypothesis.

#### Explanation of P-value

The P-value tells us that if H<sub>0</sub> were true, the probability of drawing a sample whose mean was as far from H<sub>0</sub> as the observed value of $92 is only 0.0036. Therefore, one of the following two conclusions is possible:

- H<sub>0</sub> is false.
- H<sub>0</sub> is true, which implies that of all the samples that might have been drawn, only 0.36% of them have a mean as small as or smaller than that of the sample actually drawn. In other words, our sample mean lies in the most extreme 0.36% of its distribution.

#### Calculation of P-value

$z = \frac{92 - 100}{2.972} = -2.691$

$P = 0.0036$

#### Interpretation and Conclusion

In practice, events in the most extreme 0.36% of their distributions very seldom occur. Therefore, we reject H<sub>0</sub> and conclude that the new engines will likely\Facadesignificantly increase efficiency.

#### Null Hypothesis and Plausible Value
- The null hypothesis ($H_0$) in this case specified only that $\mu \geq 100$. To give $H_0$ a fair test, we must test it in its most plausible form.
- The most plausible value for $\mu$ is the value closest to the sample mean $X$. Since $X=92$, among the values $\mu \geq 100$, the closest to $X$ is $\mu = 100.

#### Rejection of Null Hypothesis
- There is no scientific justification for a specific P-value threshold for rejecting $H_0.
- Some use the "5% rule" and reject $H_0$ if $P \leq 0.05.
 
#### Validity of the Method
- The method described relies on the Central Limit Theorem.
- For this method to be valid, the sample size must be reasonably large, typically 30 or more.

#### Calculation of P-value using Z-score
- The P-value is calculated by computing a z-score, which is a test statistic used to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis ($z = \frac{{\text{sample mean} - \text{population mean}}}{{\text{standard deviation}}}$).

#### Z-test as a Test Statistic
- A test that utilizes a z-score as a test statistic is called a z-test. 

#### Steps in Performing a Hypothesis Test:
1. **Define Hypotheses**: Set up the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1).
2. **Assume H0 to be True**: Start by assuming the null hypothesis is true.
3. **Compute Test Statistic**: Calculate a test statistic to quantify the strength of evidence against H0.
4. **Compute P-value**: Determine the probability, assuming H0 is true, that the test statistic would be as extreme as observed (P-value).
5. **State Conclusion**: Based on the P-value, draw a conclusion about the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.

#### Evidence against $H_{0}$
- The evidence we collect supports the rejection of the null hypothesis $H_{0}$.

#### Another Way to Express $H_{0}$
- Some authors express $H_{0}$ as a single value closest to $H_{1}$, e.g., $H_{0}: \mu = 100$.
- This notation clarifies the value used under the assumption of $H_{0}$ but can limit interpretation.
- Expressing $H_{0}$ as $H_{0}: \mu \geq 100$ emphasizes the range of values to be rejected.

#### Example
- The article "Wear in Boundary Lubrication" (S. Hsu, R. Munro, and M. Shen, Journal of Engineering Tribology, 2002:427–441) presents experiments on various lubricants.

#### Experiment Overview
- 45 steel balls lubricated with purified paraffin were tested.
- Load: 40 kg, RPM: 600, Duration: 60 minutes.
- Average wear: 673.2 μm, Standard deviation: 14.9 μm.

#### Hypothesis Testing
- $H_{0}: \mu \geq 675$ vs $H_{1}: \mu < 675$
- Sample mean: $\bar{X}=673.2$, Sample standard deviation: $s=14.9$

#### P-Value Calculation
- Assessing uncertainty in the sample mean to determine if population mean meets specification.

#### Large-Sample Tests for a Population Mean

The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the lubricant does not meet the specification ($\mu=675$), while the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) is that the lubricant does meet the specification.

The test statistic is the z-score, given by: $z = \frac{X - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = -0.81$.

The P-value is the probability of observing a sample mean less than or equal to 673.2, which is 0.209.

#### Null Hypothesis Testing

$H_0: \mu = 675$

A sample is considered significantly different from $H_0$ if the probability of observing the sample mean, or one more extreme, under $H_0$ is very small. In this case, since the probability is 0.209, we do not reject $H_0$ but conclude that it is plausible. The data do not conclusively support the claim that the lubricant meets the specification.

#### P-Value Interpretation

If $H_0$ is true, the probability of observing a sample as least as extreme as the observed value of 673.2 is 0.209. This probability is known as the P-value.

#### Computer Output Interpretation

The provided computer output is from a one-sample Z-test for wear. The null hypothesis tested is $\mu = 675$ against the alternative hypothesis $\mu < 675$. The computed test statistic is -0.81, and the associated P-value is 0.209.

#### Null Distribution with $μ=675$

The value $μ=675$ is used to construct the null distribution.

#### Standard Error of the Mean

The quantity "SE Mean" is the standard deviation of $X$, estimated by $s/\sqrt{n}$.

#### Confidence Bound for $μ$

The output also provides a 95% upper confidence bound for $μ$.

#### Hypothesis Testing with Normal Distribution

$H_0$: The mean reading is equal to a specific value (null hypothesis)

$H_a$: The scale is out of calibration (alternate hypothesis)

- Values of $X$ much larger or much smaller than $\mu$ provide evidence against $H_0$
- Null distribution of $X$ is normal with mean 1000 and standard deviation $\frac{2}{\sqrt{60}}=0.258$
- Calculate z-score: $z = \frac{X - 1000}{0.258} = 2.32$
- P-value is the sum of the areas in both tails of the curve that are in greater disagreement with $H_0$ than the observed value

#### Null Hypothesis and P-Value Calculation
- The null hypothesis ($H_{0}$) states that the probability of a result as extreme as or more extreme than the observed is 0.0204.
- If $H_{0}$ is true, the evidence against it is strong, leading to a decision to reject $H_{0}$.
  
#### Z-Score Calculation
- For the null distribution of X being $N(1000, 0.2582)$, the z-scores are calculated as follows:
  - $z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1000.6 - 1000}{0.2582} = 2.32$
  - The probability of observing a value as extreme as 1000.6 under $H_{0}$ is 0.0204.

#### Two-Tailed vs. One-Tailed Tests
- In a two-tailed test, both tails contribute to the P-value when $H_{0}$ specifies a single value for $\mu$.
- In a one-tailed test, only one tail contributes to the P-value when $H_{0}$ specifies that $\mu$ is greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to a value.

#### Conclusion
- Large-sample tests for a population mean involve calculating z-scores, determining P-values, and classifying tests as two-tailed or one-tailed.

#### Large-Sample Hypothesis Test for a Population Mean

Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ be a large sample from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

To test a null hypothesis of the form $H_0: \mu \leq \mu_0$, $H_0: \mu \geq \mu_0$, or $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$:
- Compute the z-score: $z = \frac{X - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$. If $\sigma$ is unknown, it may be approximated with $s$.
- Compute the P-value. The P-value is an area under the normal curve, which depends on the alternate hypothesis as follows:

| Alternate Hypothesis | P-value                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| $H_1: \mu > \mu_0$   | Area to the right of z   |
| $H_1: \mu < \mu_0$   | Area to the left of z    |
| $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$| Sum of the areas in the tails cut off by $z$ and $-z$ |

a. **P-value:** Calculate P-value to evaluate the calibration of the laser based on the sample mean error.

#### Predicting Proﬁt Performance

a. The P-value can be calculated using the given data:

The P-value for a one-tailed test can then be found using a t-table.

b. Since the calculated t-value is -2.25, which is less than the critical value for a significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu \geq 10$ and conclude that it is plausible that the mean profit margin is less than 10%.

$$ t = \frac{(1356-1350)}{\frac{70}{\sqrt{100}}} = 0.857 $$

#### a. Find the P-value.
The P-value is a measure of the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

#### b. Do you believe it is plausible that the blocks do not meet the specification, or are you convinced that they do? Explain your reasoning.
To determine whether the blocks meet the specification, one must analyze the P-value. A low P-value suggests that the data is unlikely under the null hypothesis, leading to a rejection of the null hypothesis and indicating that the blocks do not meet the specification.

#### Fill in the blank: If the null hypothesis is $H_0: \mu \leq 5$, then the mean of $X$ under the null distribution is $5$.

#### Fill in the blank: In a test of $H_0: \mu \geq 10$ versus $H_1: \mu < 10$, the sample mean was $X=8$ and the P-value was $0.04$. This means that if $\mu = 10$, and the experiment were repeated 100 times, we would expect to obtain a value of $X$ of $8$ or less approximately $4$ times.

e. **99% Confidence Interval for μ**: $(72.8614, 73.6308)$

#### Filling in Missing Numbers:

a. $SE \, \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{StDev}}{\sqrt{N}} = \frac{2.00819}{\sqrt{87}} \approx 0.21539$

c. From the Z-table for $\text{Z} = 2.8789, P \approx 0.0020$

#### Conclusions in Hypothesis Testing

In hypothesis testing, two key conclusions can be reached:

1. **$H_0$ is false**: This conclusion is made when the null hypothesis is rejected based on the evidence from the test.

2. **$H_0$ is plausible**: This conclusion is made when there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, it does not imply that the null hypothesis is true.

It is important to note that in hypothesis testing, one can never conclusively prove that the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is true.

#### Level of Disagreement and P-Value
The level of disagreement, measured by the P-value, determines if the null hypothesis is implausible. The smaller the P-value, the less plausible the null hypothesis becomes. Typically, if $P \leq 0.05$, the null hypothesis is rejected.

#### Rejection of the Null Hypothesis
When the P-value is small, it indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. However, there is no sharp dividing line determining when to reject the null hypothesis, similar to how there is no clear line between hot and cold weather.

#### Summary
- The smaller the P-value, the more certain we can be that the null hypothesis is false.
- The larger the P-value, the more plausible the null hypothesis becomes, but certainty of it being true is not guaranteed.
- A common rule is to reject the null hypothesis if $P \leq 0.05$, but this rule lacks scientific justification.

#### Statistical Significance
Result is deemed statistically significant when the P-value is less than a predefined threshold.

#### Significance Levels and Hypothesis Testing

When conducting hypothesis tests, the significance level, often denoted by $\alpha$, indicates the probability threshold for determining statistical significance. It is commonly set at 0.05, 0.01, or other predefined values.

- If $P \leq 0.05$, the result is statistically significant at the 5% level.
- If $P \leq 0.01$, the result is statistically significant at the 1% level.

#### Example

For a null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 0$ with a P-value of 0.03:
- The result is statistically significant at the 10% and 5% levels but not at the 1% level.
- The null hypothesis is rejected at the 10% and 5% levels but not at the 1% level.

#### Conclusions from the Results of Hypothesis Tests

- Reporting a result as statistically significant at a certain level without providing the P-value can be misleading.
- It is important to know the exact P-value as it indicates the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.
- Implying significance at a specific level, such as 5%, may not accurately convey the magnitude of the difference.
- Readers should have access to the P-value to make informed decisions about whether to reject the null hypothesis.

#### Reporting P-values

- The P-value provides information on the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.
- Including P-values in hypothesis test results is important for readers to make their own decisions on whether to reject the null hypothesis.

#### Summary

- If $P \leq \alpha$, the test is statistically significant at the $100\alpha\%$ level.
- The null hypothesis is rejected at the $100\alpha\%$ level.
- Always report the P-value when reporting the result of a hypothesis test.

#### Misconception about P-value

- The P-value is not the probability that $H_0$ is true.
- Small P-values suggest $H_0$ is unlikely to be true, but the P-value does not indicate the probability that $H_0$ is true.

#### P-value Definition
The P-value is the probability of observing an extreme value of a statistic $X$ when experiments are repeated.

#### Null Hypothesis
The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is either true or not true, and its truth or falsehood cannot be changed by repeating the experiment.

#### Types of Probability
There is a difference between frequentist probability (discussed here) and subjective probability (used in Bayesian statistics). We are focusing on frequentist probability.

#### Reference
For more on Bayesian statistics, refer to Lee's book from 2013.

#### Importance of Choosing H0 and H1 Appropriately

When conducting hypothesis tests, selecting the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1) correctly is crucial for obtaining meaningful conclusions from the test results.

#### Example 6.4: Water Pipe Breaking Strength

Given a scenario where engineers need to make a decision about using a specific type of water pipe with a mean breaking strength μ, it is essential to set up the hypotheses appropriately to guide the decision-making process.

#### Conclusion based on Hypothesis Test

- If H0: μ ≤ 2000 is rejected (i.e., evidence supports μ > 2000), the engineers will use the pipe.
- If H0 is not rejected (suggesting μ ≤ 2000 remains a possibility), the engineers will not use the pipe.

#### Engineers' Decision Regarding Using the Pipe
- Engineers will not use the pipe if $H_0$ is rejected, indicating $\mu < 2000$
- Engineers will not use the pipe if $H_0$ is not rejected, suggesting uncertainty about $\mu \geq 2000$

#### Example 6.5 Decision on Pipe Usage
- Engineers will still not use the pipe regardless of $H_0$ being rejected or not
- Specified hypotheses $H_0$ and $H_1$ are incorrect, making the test pointless

#### Final Note: One-tailed Test Equality
- In a one-tailed test, equality aligns with the null hypothesis, such as $H_0: \mu \leq \mu_0$ where $\mu_0$ divides $H_0$ and $H_1$

#### Interpretation of Hypothesis Testing Results
$H_0: \mu \geq \mu_0$, never $H_0: \mu < \mu_0$ or $H_0: \mu > \mu_0$ because during null distribution definition, we choose the value of $\mu$ closest to $\mu_1$. Without equality, no specific value specified by $H_0$ is closest to $H_1$.

#### Statistical vs. Practical Significance
Statistical significance (small P-value) does not always imply practical importance. A result may be statistically significant but lack scientific or practical importance, as illustrated by the example of fiber breaking strength manufacturing process.

#### Hypothesis Testing for Mean Breaking Strength of Fibers

Given a sample of 1000 fibers with an average breaking strength of $50.1$ N and a standard deviation of $1$ N, we want to determine if the new process produces fibers with a greater mean breaking strength.

- Null Hypothesis: $H_0: \mu \leq 50$
- Alternative Hypothesis: $H_1: \mu > 50$

Under $H_0$, the sample mean $X$ has a normal distribution with mean $50$ and standard deviation $0.0316$. The $z$-score is calculated as $z = 3.16$, resulting in a P-value of $0.0008, which strongly rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the new process producing fibers with greater mean breaking strength.

#### Practical Implication

Based on the hypothesis test, it is evident that the new process yields fibers with a superior mean breaking strength. However, the decision to implement the new process may not be worthwhile despite this improvement.

#### Statistical Significance vs. Practical Importance

The difference between the old and new processes, although highly statistically significant, amounts to only $0.1 N$. It is unlikely that this difference is large enough to matter. The lesson here is that a result can be statistically significant without being large enough to be of practical importance.

#### Factors Affecting Statistical Significance

A difference is statistically significant when it is large compared to its standard deviation. In this example, a difference of $0.1 N$ was statistically significant because the standard deviation was only $0.0316 N$. When the standard deviation is very small, even a small difference can be statistically significant.

#### Understanding P-Value

The P-value does not measure practical significance. What it does measure is the degree of confidence we can have that the true value is really different from the value specified by the null hypothesis. When the P-value is small, then we can be confident that the true value is really different. This does not necessarily imply that the difference is large enough to be of practical importance.

#### Relationship Between Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals

When it comes to determining plausible values for a quantity like population mean μ:
- **Hypothesis Test**: Specifies a particular value for μ (null hypothesis) and checks its plausibility.
- **Confidence Interval**: Represents all values for μ meeting a certain plausibility criterion (specified by confidence level 100(1 − α)%).

In a two-sided level 100(1 − α)% confidence interval for μ, the values are exactly where the P-value of a two-tailed hypothesis test would be greater than α.

#### Confidence Interval Calculation

Given data:
- Sample mean, $X=12.68$
- Standard deviation, $s=6.83$
- Sample size, $n=50$
- Confidence level, $1-\alpha = 0.95$

The 95% confidence interval for the population mean lifetime $\mu$ is calculated as $(10.79, 14.57)$.

#### Hypothesis Testing

Consider testing:
- $H_0: \mu = 10.79$
- $H_1: \mu \neq 10.79$

Under $H_0$, the observed value $X=12.68$ comes from a normal distribution with mean $10.79$ and standard deviation $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}=0.9659$.

The z-score is calculated as $\frac{12.68 - 10.79}{0.9659} = 1.96$.

Both tails contribute to the P-value, which is calculated as $0.05$ for $H_0: \mu = 10.79$.

#### Conclusion

The P-value for testing $H_0: \mu=10.79$ is equal to $0.05$.

#### Testing Hypothesis

Let's test the hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 14.57$ versus $H_1: \mu \neq 14.57$.

Given:
- $14.57$ is the other endpoint of the confidence interval.
- Calculate $z = \frac{12.68 - 14.57}{0.9659} = -1.96$.
- P-value is $0.05$.

If we choose $\mu_0$ in the interval $(10.79, 14.57)$ and test $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$, the P-value will be greater than $0.05. However, for $\mu_0 < 10.79$ or $\mu_0 > 14.57$, the P-value will be less than $0.05.

#### Confidence Interval

The 95% confidence interval contains values of $\mu$ whose P-values are greater than $0.05$ in a hypothesis test. It includes all plausible values for the population mean $\mu$.

A one-sided level $100(1 - \alpha)%$ confidence interval consists of values where the P-value in a one-tailed test would be greater than $\alpha$. For example, with $X = 12.68$, $s = 6.83$, and $n = 50$, the 95% lower confidence bound for the lifetime of the drills is $11.09$.

#### Concepts in Hypothesis Testing

1. **Significance Level and P-value Relationship**:
   - Given $\alpha = 0.05$, when the P-value for testing $H_0: \mu \leq \mu_0$ is greater than 0.05, it indicates insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
   - Similar interpretation applies in the case of testing $H_0: \mu \geq \mu_0$ with a P-value greater than 0.05.

2. **Confidence Intervals**:

#### Reference to Article
7. The article “The Effect of Restricting Opening Hours on Alcohol-Related Violence” presented homicide rates for the years 1995–2005 for the town.

#### Given Information
- In 2002, a law was passed requiring bars to close at 11 pm each night.
- After the law’s passage, the homicide rate dropped by an average of 9 homicides per month, a statistically significant decrease.

#### Options for Conclusion
i. It is reasonable to conclude that the law is responsible for a reduction of 9 homicides per month.

ii. It is reasonable to conclude that the law is responsible for a reduction in homicides, but the actual amount might be somewhat more or less than $9$ per month.

iii. It is reasonable to conclude that the homicide rate decreased, but the law may not have anything to do with the decrease.

iv. It is plausible that the homicide rate may not have decreased at all after the passage of the law.

#### Question 8

To determine whether a work-place is safe, the most appropriate null hypothesis would be $H_0: \mu \leq 5$. This is because in this case, the null hypothesis usually represents the status quo or the current situation, where the mean safety level is at most 5. The alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) would then be $H_a: \mu > 5$, indicating that the workplace is not safe if the mean safety level is greater than 5.

#### Question 9

a. The most appropriate null hypothesis regarding the population mean $\mu$ for the new type of battery for heart pacemakers would be $H_0: \mu \leq 8$. This is because the goal is to show that the new battery has a mean lifetime greater than 8 years.

b. The most appropriate null hypothesis for the new material for manufacturing tires would be $H_0: \mu \leq 60,000$. The aim is to demonstrate that the mean lifetime of tires using the new material is more than 60,000 miles.

c. The most suitable null hypothesis for the quality control inspector recalibrating a flowmeter would be $H_0: \mu = 10$. This is because the inspector is concerned that the mean flow rate differs from 10 mL/s and wants to test if it equals to 10 mL/s.

#### Question 10

For the recommended installation of a radon abatement device in homes where the mean radon concentration is 4.0 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) or more, the appropriate null hypothesis would be $H_0: \mu = 4.0$. This is based on the assumption that if the mean radon concentration equals or exceeds 4.0 pCi/L, there could be an increased risk of cancer due to long-term exposure to high doses of radon.

#### Mean Concentration and Radon Abatement
- $ \text{Mean Concentration} = 3.72 \, \text{pCi/L} $
- $ \text{Standard Deviation} = 1.93 \, \text{pCi/L} $

#### Mistaken Reasoning of Home Inspector
- The reasoning that radon abatement is not necessary due to mean measurement being less than 4.0 pCi/L is incorrect because radon abatement should be considered based on health concerns rather than a specific mean threshold.

#### Hypotheses for Radon Abatement
- Null Hypothesis: $ H_0: \mu = 4.0 \, \text{pCi/L} $
- Alternate Hypothesis: $ H_1: \mu > 4.0 \, \text{pCi/L} $

#### P-Value Calculation and Recommendation
- Compute the P-value to determine if radon abatement is necessary based on the given data and significance level. The recommendation for radon abatement would depend on the P-value obtained from the analysis.

#### Scale Calibration Test
- Population mean reading on the scale ($ \mu $) needs to be compared to the standard weight of 10 g to determine if the scale is in calibration.
- Hypotheses: $ H_0: \mu = 10 $ vs. $ H_1: \mu \neq 10 $

#### Conclusions
- The three possible conclusions from the scale calibration test are:
  - (i) The scale is in calibration.
  - (ii) The scale is out of calibration.
  - (iii) The scale might be in calibration, indicating uncertainty about the calibration status.

#### a. Which of the three conclusions is best if $H_0$ is rejected?

If $H_0$ is rejected, it implies that there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$).

#### b. Which of the three conclusions is best if $H_0$ is not rejected?

If $H_0$ is not rejected, it implies that there is not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$).

#### c. Is it possible to perform a hypothesis test in a way that makes it possible to demonstrate conclusively that the scale is in calibration? Explain.

It is not possible to conclusively demonstrate that the scale is in calibration through hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing can only provide evidence in support or against a particular hypothesis, but it does not provide absolute proof.

#### Question 14

A 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ is (1.2, 2.0). Based on the data from which the confidence interval was constructed, someone wants to test:
- $H_0: \mu = 1.4$ versus $H_1: \mu \neq 1.4$. The P-value will be:
  - i. Greater than 0.05
  - ii. Less than 0.05
  - iii. Equal to 0.05

#### Question 15

Refer to Exercise 14. For which null hypothesis will $P=0.05$?
- i. $H_0: \mu = 1.2$
- ii. $H_0: \mu \leq 1.2$
- iii. $H_0: \mu \geq 1.2$

#### Question 16

A scientist computes a 90% confidence interval to be (4.38, 6.02). Using the same data, she also computes a 95% confidence interval to be (4.22, 6.18), and a 99% confidence interval to be (3.91, 6.49). Now she wants to test:
- $H_0: \mu = 4$ versus $H_1: \mu \neq 4$. Regarding the P-value, which one of the following statements is true?
  - i. $P > 0.10$
  - ii. $0.05 < P < 0.10$
  - iii. $0.01 < P < 0.05$
  - iv. $P < 0.01$

#### Question 17

The strength of a certain type of rubber is tested by subjecting pieces of the rubber to an abrasion test. For the rubber to be acceptable, the mean weight loss $\mu$ must be less than 3.5 mg.

#### Confidence Interval for Mean Weight Loss

Given a 95% upper confidence bound for the mean weight loss as 3.45 mg.

a. $H_0: \mu \geq 3.5$ vs $H_1: \mu < 3.5$

- It is not possible to determine if $P<0.05$ from the confidence bound.

b. $H_0: \mu \leq 50$ vs $H_1: \mu > 50$

- It is not possible to determine if $P<0.01$ from the confidence bound.

#### Confidence Interval for Mean Breaking Strength

Given a 98% lower confidence bound for the mean breaking strength as 50.1 N.

a. $H_0: \mu \leq 50$ vs $H_1: \mu > 50$

- It is not possible to determine if $P<0.01$ from the confidence bound.

b. $H_0: \mu \leq 50$ vs $H_1: \mu > 50$

- It is not possible to determine if $P<0.05$ from the confidence bound.

#### Exercise 17

Given the mean of the sample used to compute the confidence bound as $X=3.40$, to determine if $P<0.01$ we need additional information such as the standard deviation or the sample size. Without this information, it is not possible to determine if $P<0.01$.

#### Exercise 18

In this case, knowing that the standard deviation of the sample used to compute the confidence interval is $5 N$, we still lack information about the confidence level or sample size to determine whether $P<0.01$.

#### Exercise 21

a. Based on the given MINITAB output, since the p-value is $0.196 > 0.05$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at the 5% significance level.

b. Without doing any calculations, we can conclude that since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at the 5% significance level.

#### 6.3 Tests for a Population Proportion

A population proportion is simply a population mean for a population.

#### Hypothesis Test for Proportions

The hypothesis test for proportions involves testing a claim about the proportion of a population. In this case, we are interested in determining if a supplier's claim that no more than 10% of semiconductor wafers are defective is true.

The sample proportion $\hat{p}$, representing the proportion of defective wafers in a sample, is used to make inferences about the population proportion $p$. Under the assumption of independent sampling, the sample proportion approximately follows a normal distribution with mean $p$ and standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ according to the Central Limit Theorem, where $n$ is the sample size.

The hypothesis test involves formulating null and alternative hypotheses, calculating a test statistic based on the sample proportion, determining the critical value or p-value, and making a decision based on the significance level.

In this specific example, with a sample size of 400 wafers and 50 of them being defective (12.5%), we can conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the supplier's claim of a defective rate of no more than 10% is supported by the data.

#### Null and Alternate Hypotheses
$
H_{0}: p \leq 0.1 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_{1}: p > 0.1
$

#### Null Distribution of $\hat{p}$
$
\hat{p} \sim N(0.1, 2.25 \times 10^{-4})
$

#### Z-Score Calculation
$
z = \frac{0.125 - 0.1}{0.015} = 1.67
$

#### Probability from Z-Table
The probability that a standard normal random variable has a value greater than 1.67 is approximately 0.

#### P-value Calculation
- The P-value is calculated as 0.0475 based on the null distribution with parameters $\hat{\pi} \sim N(0.1, 0.015^2)$.

#### Analysis
- If the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is true, the probability of observing a value as extreme as or more extreme than 0.125 is 0.0475.
- This suggests that either the supplier's claim is false or the sample is quite unusual, but not incredibly rare.
- It is prudent to be skeptical of the claim but not to conclusively reject it based on this result.

#### Significance Level
- According to the conventional significance level of 0.05, $P = 0.0475 < 0.05$, suggesting rejection of $H_0$.
- However, this example highlights the limitation of blindly following this rule without considering the context or additional factors.

#### The Importance of P-Values

- The fate of a supplier can hang on a single wafer out of a batch of 400.
- It is better to report the P-value and wait for more evidence before reaching a conclusion.

#### Sample Size for Testing Population Proportion

- The sample proportion must be approximately normally distributed for tests.
- Assumption justified when $np_0 > 10$ and $n(1 - p_0) > 10$.
- Use z-test with z-score as the test statistic.

#### Example: Refinement of Gravimetric Geoid

- A method for measuring orthometric heights above sea level from a sample of 1225 baselines, out of which 926 gave results.

#### Concept: Hypothesis Testing

Let $p$ denote the probability that the method produces a result within the tolerance limits. 

- Null Hypothesis: $H_0: p \leq 0.75$
- Alternate Hypothesis: $H_1: p > 0.75$

The sample proportion is $\hat{p} = \frac{926}{1225} = 0.7559$. Under the null hypothesis, $\hat{p}$ is normally distributed with mean 0.75 and standard deviation $\sqrt{\frac{0.75 \times (1 - 0.75)}{1225}} = 0.0124$. 

The z-score is calculated as: 
$$z = \frac{0.7559 - 0.7500}{0.0124} = 0.48$$

The P-value is 0.3156. We cannot conclude that the method produces results within the tolerance limits more than 75% of the time.

The probability of observing a value as extreme as or more extreme than the observed value of 0.7559 under the null hypothesis is the P-value.

#### Test and Confidence Interval for One Proportion (GPS)
$H_0: p = 0.75$ vs $H_1: p > 0.75$

- Sample size: $n = 1225$
- Sample proportion: $\hat{p} = 0.755918$
- 95% Lower confidence bound: $0.735732$
- Z-Value: $0.48$
- P-Value: $0.316$

#### Relationship with Confidence Intervals for a Proportion
A $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence interval for a population mean $\mu$ contains values for the parameter where the P-value of a hypothesis test will be greater than $\alpha$. This statement is approximately true for proportion confidence intervals, as they are modifications of a more complex method for which this statement holds exactly.

#### Success Probability $p$ and Binomial Distribution
- Success probability $p$ where $X \sim \text{Bin}(n, p)$.

#### Hypothesis Testing
- Null hypothesis $H_0: p \leq p_0$, $H_0: p \geq p_0$, or $H_0: p = p_0$.
- Compute z-score: $z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}$.
- Compute the P-value based on the alternate hypothesis:
  * $H_1: p > p_0$ - Area to the right of $z$.
  * $H_1: p < p_0$ - Area to the left of $z$.
  * $H_1: p \neq p_0$ - Sum of areas in the tails cut off by $z$ and $-z$.

#### Circuit Manufacturing Process
Given that only 35 out of the first 1000 circuits manufactured show evidence of undercutting, we cannot conclusively determine if the goal of reducing undercutting has been met without more context.

#### HIV-positive Smokers Survey
With 281 males and 163 females surveyed among 444 HIV-positive smokers, we cannot confidently conclude that more than 60% of HIV-positive smokers are male based on this information.

#### Bathroom Scales Accuracy
When 150 lb test weight was placed on 50 bathroom scales, 29 showed lighter readings and 21 showed heavier readings. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine if more than half of bathroom scales tend to underestimate weight.

#### Setting Speed Limits on Gravel Roads
The article evaluating criteria for setting speed limits on gravel roads measured vehicle speeds in the state of [missing information].

#### 1. More than half of the vehicles on South Cedar Niles exceed the speed limit?

We can use the sample proportion to test this hypothesis.

Let $p$ be the proportion of vehicles exceeding the speed limit.

$H_0: p = 0.5$ (Half of the vehicles exceed the speed limit)  
$H_1: p > 0.5$ (More than half of the vehicles exceed the speed limit)

Calculate the proportion of vehicles exceeding the speed limit:

$\hat{p} = \frac{49}{73} \approx 0.6712$

Since $\hat{p} > 0.5$, we can conclude that more than half of the vehicles on South Cedar Niles exceed the speed limit.

#### 2. More than half of the residents in town are opposed to constructing a new shopping mall?

Again, we can use the sample proportion to test this hypothesis.

Let $p$ be the proportion of residents opposed to constructing a new shopping mall.

$H_0: p = 0.5$ (Half of the residents are opposed to constructing a new mall)  
$H_1: p > 0.5$ (More than half of the residents are opposed to constructing a new mall)

Calculate the proportion of residents opposed to constructing a new shopping mall:

$\hat{p} = \frac{274}{500} = 0.548$

Since $\hat{p} > 0.5$, we can conclude that more than half of the residents in this town are opposed to constructing a new shopping mall.

#### 3. The frequency of hip replacement surgery differs between right and left hips?

We can use a hypothesis test for two population proportions to answer this question.

$H_0: p_{\text{right}} = p_{\text{left}}$ (The frequency of surgery is the same for right and left hips)  
$H_1: p_{\text{right}} \neq p_{\text{left}}$ (The frequency of surgery differs between right and left hips)

Calculate the proportions of people undergoing surgery on their right and left hips:

$\hat{p}_{\text{right}} = \frac{65}{113} \approx 0.5752$  
$\hat{p}_{\text{left}} = 1 - \hat{p}_{\text{right}} = 0.4248$

Since the proportions are different, we can conclude that the frequency of this type of surgery differs between right and left hips.

#### Household Internet Access

To determine if more than 70% of households have high-speed internet access:
- Letting $p$ be the true proportion of households with high-speed internet access
- We can test the null hypothesis $H_0: p \leq 0.70$ against the alternative hypothesis $H_1: p > 0.70$

#### Machine Qualification

To determine if the grinding machine can be qualified:
- Letting $p$ be the true proportion of defective parts
- We can test the null hypothesis $H_0: p \leq 0.08$ against the alternative hypothesis $H_1: p > 0.08$
- Calculate the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ and conduct a hypothesis test using a known population proportion

#### Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

To determine if the locus is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:
- Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is met if the observed genotype frequencies match the expected frequencies under the equilibrium
- Use the formula $(p_A \times p_B) = 0.12$ to calculate the expected proportion of type AB organisms
- Compare the observed proportion from the sample to the expected proportion

#### Pollution Levels in State

To conclude if less than half of the automobiles exceed the pollution standard:
- Use statistical analysis from Exercise 1 in Section 5.2 to determine if the pollution levels meet the standard
- Conduct hypothesis testing to compare the pollution levels to the standard

#### Residences in Town

To conclude if more than 60% of residences are of a certain type:
- Use statistical analysis from Exercise 2 in Section 5.2 to determine the proportion of residences in the town
- Conduct hypothesis testing to compare the proportion to the given threshold

#### Hypothesis Testing for Population Proportion

a. **One-Tailed Test**
  
b. **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** $p = 0.4$
  
c. **Rejecting $H_0$ at 2% Level**
  
d. **Null Hypothesis**: $H_0: p \geq 0.45$; **Cannot Reject without Calculations**
  
e. **Compute P-value:** $P(\text{Z} \leq -3.03) = 0.001$
  
f. **Confidence Interval:** $(0.304167, 0.353013)$

#### Small-Sample Tests for a Population Mean

When dealing with small samples for hypothesis testing on a population mean, the sample standard deviation ($s$) may not be close to the population standard deviation ($\sigma$), rendering the large-sample method invalid. In such cases, when the population is approximately normal, the Student's $t$-distribution is used instead. This distribution helps find the P-value for the hypothesis test.

**Example:** Consider spacer collars for a transmission countershaft with a thickness specification of 38.98–39.02 mm. The process aims for a mean thickness of 39.00 mm. A sample of sizesTextColor{red}{N} = 35 is taken.

#### Hypotheses
- $H_{0}: \mu=39.00$ 
- $H_{1}: \mu \neq 39.00$

#### Test Statistic
- $t = \frac{X - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = 2.327$

#### Conclusion
- Since the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution with 5 degrees of freedom, compare the P-value to determine if the process needs recalibration.

#### Test Statistic for Two-Tailed Test

The test statistic's absolute value is as extreme as the observed value. For a two-tailed test with H0: μ=39.00, the P-value is the sum of areas under the curve of t>2.327 and t<-2.327.

#### P-Value Calculation

Using the t-table for 5 degrees of freedom, we find that t=±2.015 cuts off an area of 0.05 in each tail and t=±2.571 cuts off an area of 0.025 in each tail. Thus, the P-value falls between 0.05 and 0.10.

#### Conclusion

While not conclusive, the P-value suggests the process may be out of calibration, indicating it may be wise to recalibrate.

#### Null Distribution of t-Statistic
The null distribution of the t-statistic, calculated as $t=\frac{X-\bar{X}}{(s/\sqrt{n})}$, follows Student’s t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the sample size minus 1. 

#### Interpretation of t-Value
If the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is true, the probability that the t-statistic takes on a value as extreme as or more extreme than the observed value is determined as the P-value, which falls between 0.05 and 0.10. Both tails of the t-distribution contribute to the P-value since $H_0$ specifies equality to a specific value.

#### t-Test vs. z-Score
In this example, the test statistic used is a t-statistic rather than a z-score, hence known as a t-test. 

#### Example: pH Measurement
In a study on sludge samples from a wastewater treatment plant, the mean pH of six replicates was found to be 6.68.

#### Mean pH hypothesis test
Given standard deviation $\sigma = 0.20$, to test if mean pH is less than 7.0:
- **Null Hypothesis:** $H_0: \mu \geq 7.0$
- **Alternate Hypothesis:** $H_1: \mu < 7.0$

The test statistic is calculated as:
$$t = \frac{X - 7.0}{s/\sqrt{n}} = -3.919$$

Using the t-table, the area of the left-hand tail for a value of -3.365 is 0.01 and for -4.033 is 0.005. Therefore, the P-value is between 0.005 and 0.01. We conclude there is strong evidence that the mean pH is less than 7.0.

#### One-Sample T-Test Results
- Null Hypothesis: $\mu = 7$ vs $\mu < 7$
- Test Statistic: $T = -3.92$
- P-Value: $0.006$
- Conclusion: The upper 95% confidence bound indicates that the P-value is less than 5%.

#### Using Z-test when $\sigma$ is Known
- For small samples from a normal population with known $\sigma$, use Z-test instead of T-test.
- This involves using the Z-table and performing a Z-test rather than a T-test.
- Example 6.8 will illustrate this alternate method.

#### Hypotheses
$H_0: \mu = 39.00$ versus $H_1: \mu \neq 39.00$

#### Computation
Given: $\bar{X} = 39.01133$, $\sigma = 0.010$, sample size $n = 6$

Since the population is normal, $\bar{X}$ is normal even with a small sample size. The null distribution is $\bar{X} \sim N(39.00, 0.010^2)$.

The z-score is calculated as: $z = \frac{39.01133 - 39.000}{0.010 / \sqrt{6}} = 2.78$

The P-value is 0.0054, indicating rejection of $H_0$.

#### Summary
Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ be a sample from a normal population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

#### Test of Hypothesis

To test a null hypothesis of the form $H_0: \mu \leq \mu_0$, $H_0: \mu \geq \mu_0$, or $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$:
- Compute the test statistic $t = \frac{X - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$.
- Compute the P-value. The P-value is an area under the Student’s t curve with $n-1$ degrees of freedom, which depends on the alternate hypothesis as follows:
    - For $H_1: \mu > \mu_0$, P-value is the area to the right of $t$.
    - For $H_1: \mu < \mu_0$, P-value is the area to the left of $t$.
    - For $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$, P-value is the sum of the areas in the tails cut off by $t$ and $-t$.

If $\sigma$ is known, the test statistic is $z = \frac{X - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$, and a z-test should be performed.

#### Hypothesis Testing for Population Means

The production manager wants to compare the mean diameters of ball bearings produced in the morning and afternoon. 

- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The mean diameter of ball bearings produced in the morning is the same as those produced in the afternoon.
  
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):** The mean diameter of ball bearings produced in the morning is smaller than those produced in the afternoon.
  
- **Test Statistic:** The difference in sample means $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$.

- **Conclusion:** Calculate the p-value. If the p-value < significance level, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that ball bearings produced in the morning have smaller diameters on average.

#### Hypotheses:
- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $μ_X - μ_Y ≥ 0$
- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): $μ_X - μ_Y < 0$

#### Test Statistic:
- The test is based on $X - Y$

#### Assumptions:
- Both sample sizes are large.
- $X$ and $Y$ are both approximately normally distributed.

#### Null Distribution of $X - Y$
Given:
$$X - Y \sim N\left(\mu_X - \mu_Y, \sigma_X^2/n_X + \sigma_Y^2/n_Y\right)$$

#### Standard Deviation Calculation
Substitute:
- $X = 5.068$, $Y = 5.072$
- $s_X = 0.011$, $s_Y = 0.007$
- $n_X = 120$, $n_Y = 65$

Calculate:
$$\sqrt{\frac{0.011^2}{120} + \frac{0.007^2}{65}} = 0.001327$$

#### Null Distribution of $X - Y$
Therefore:
$$X - Y \sim N(0, 0.001327^2)$$

#### Z-Score Calculation
Given:
$$X - Y = 5.068 - 5.072 = -0.004$$

Calculate z-score:
$$z = \frac{-0.004 - 0}{0.001327} = -3.01$$

#### P-Value and Conclusion
- P-Value = 0.0013
- Conclusion: The bearings manufactured in the morning have a smaller mean diameter

#### Final Result
$$z = -3.01, P = 0.0013$$

#### Null Distribution and P-Value

The null distribution of $X-Y$ is $N(0, 0.0013272)$. If $H_0$ is true, the probability that $X-Y$ takes on a value as extreme as or more extreme than the observed value of $-0.004$ is $0.0013`.

#### Independent Samples Assumption

When computing the variance of $X-Y`, we used the assumption that the samples were independent. This assumption is typically easy to achieve in practice. Unless there is an obvious connection between the items in the two samples, it is reasonable to assume they are independent.

#### Inclusions Diameter Study

Given:
- Sample mean diameter for argon welds ($X=0.37$ μm, $s_X=0.25$ μm, $n_X=544$)
- Sample mean diameter for carbon dioxide welds ($Y=0.40$ μm, $s_Y=0.26$ μm, $n_Y=581)

Hypotheses:
- $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = 0$
- $H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y \neq 0$

Observations:
- $X - Y = 0.37 - 0.40 = -0.03$

To determine if the mean diameters of inclusions differ between the two shielding gases, we need to perform a hypothesis test based on the given data.

#### Normal Population Parameters
$μ_X - μ_Y$, $s_X^2/n_X + s_Y^2/n_Y$

#### Null Hypothesis under H0
$μ_X - μ_Y = 0$

#### Standard Deviation Calculation
$\sqrt{0.252/544 + 0.262/581} = 0.01521$

#### Null Distribution and z-score
$X - Y \sim N(0, 0.015212)$  
$z = (-0.03 - 0) / 0.01521 = -1.97$

#### Two-Tailed Test and P-value
$P\text{-value} = 0.0488$  
Reject null hypothesis at 5% level of significance

#### MINITAB Output
- Argon: $N=544, \text{Mean} = 0.37, \text{StDev} = 0.25$
- CO2: $N=581, \text{Mean} = 0.40, \text{StDev} = 0.26$
- Difference: $\mu(\text{Argon}) - \mu(\text{CO2}) = 0.030$

#### T-Test of Difference

The T-Test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. In this test:
$H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = 0$  
$H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y \neq 0$

#### Test Statistics

- T-Value: $-1.97$
- P-Value: $0.049$
- Degrees of Freedom: $1122$

#### Computer vs. Manual Calculations

- Computers use the t-statistic when estimating population standard deviation using sample standard deviation.
- For large sample sizes, the difference between t and z statistics is negligible.
- Using z-scores with tables provides greater precision for P-values compared to t-tables.

#### Null Distribution and Z-Score
Under $H_0$, we have $\mu_X - \mu_Y = -0.015$.

The null distribution of $X - Y$ is $X - Y \sim N(-0.015, 0.015212)$.

We observe $X - Y = 0.37 - 0.40 = -0.03$. The z-score is:

$z = \frac{-0.03 - (-0.015)}{0.01521} = -0.99$

This is a one-tailed test. The P-value is 0.1611. We cannot conclude that the mean diameter of inclusions from carbon dioxide welds exceeds that of argon welds by more than 0.015 μm.

#### Summary
For large samples from populations with means $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$, and standard deviations $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$:

To test a null hypothesis of the form $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \leq \Delta_1$, $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \geq \Delta_1$, or $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = \Delta_1$:
- Compute the z-score: $z = \frac{(X - Y) - \Delta_1}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{n_Y}}}$. If $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ are unknown, use $s_X$ and $s_Y$.
- Compute the P-value.

#### P-value definition
The P-value is an area under the normal curve, dependent on the alternate hypothesis as follows:
- $H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y > \Delta$: Area to the right of $z$
- $H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y < \Delta$: Area to the left of $z$
- $H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y \neq \Delta$: Sum of the areas in the tails cut off by $z$ and $-z$

#### Concepts related to Comparison of Routing Protocols

$X = 170$  
$Y = 123$  
$p_X = \frac{X}{200} = 0.85$  
$p_Y = \frac{Y}{150} = 0.82$

To determine if protocol A has a higher success rate, we need to conduct a hypothesis test to compare the proportions $p_X$ and $p_Y$.

#### Binomial Distribution and Sample Proportions

Given:
$X \sim B(200, p_X)$ and $Y \sim B(150, p_Y)$ with sample proportions $\hat{p}_X = 0.85$ and $\hat{p}_Y = 0.82$.

#### Hypotheses
$H_0: p_X - p_Y \leq 0$ 
$H_1: p_X - p_Y > 0$

#### Central Limit Theorem
Since $n_X$ and $n_Y$ are large:
$\hat{p}_X \sim N\left(p_X, \frac{p_X(1-p_X)}{n_X}\right)$
$\hat{p}_Y \sim N\left(p_Y, \frac{p_Y(1-p_Y)}{n_Y}\right)$

#### Test Statistic Distribution
$\hat{p}_X - \hat{p}_Y \sim N\left(p_X - p_Y, \frac{p_X(1-p_X)}{n_X} + \frac{p_Y(1-p_Y)}{n_Y}\right)$

#### Pooled Proportion for Two Proportions

When testing the difference between two proportions, it is important to estimate a common value for the population proportions. The pooled proportion is calculated by dividing the total number of successes in both samples by the total sample size:

$$\hat{p}_{\bar{X}+\bar{Y}} = \frac{X + Y}{nX + nY}$$

#### Null Distribution of the Difference Between Two Proportions

The null distribution of $\hat{p}_{X} - \hat{p}_{Y}$ is estimated by substituting the pooled proportion $\hat{p}$ for both $p_{X}$ and $p_{Y}$ into the expression. This results in:

$$\hat{p}_{X} - \hat{p}_{Y} \sim N\left(0, \hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})\left(\frac{1}{nX} + \frac{1}{nY}\right)\right)$$

#### Example Calculation

In an example where $\hat{p} = \frac{170 + 123}{200 + 150} = 0.837$ and under the null hypothesis $p_{X} - p_{Y} = 0$, the null distribution of $\hat{p}_{X} - \hat{p}_{Y}$ can be determined using the above formula.

#### Z-Score Calculation

Given variables:

- $ \mu_X = 0 $
- $ \sigma = \sqrt{0.837(1-0.837)(\frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{150})} = 0.0399 $
- $ \hat{p}_X - \hat{p}_Y = 0.85 - 0.82 = 0.03 $

Calculate z-score:

$$ z = \frac{0.03 - 0}{0.0399} = 0.75 $$

#### P-Value Calculation

P-value is calculated as 0.2266. Since P-value is greater than 0.05, we cannot conclude that protocol B has a greater success rate.

#### Central Limit Theorem

For the Central Limit Theorem to be valid, both samples must be reasonably large. It is recommended to have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each sample.

#### Technique of Risk Management

Given:
- Sample proportion of oil companies employing risk transfer methods: $\hat{p}_{X}=0.5116$
- Sample proportion of construction companies employing risk transfer methods: $\hat{p}_{Y}=0.5914$

- **Null Hypothesis:** $H_0: p_X = p_Y$ (proportion of oil companies employing risk transfer = proportion of construction companies employing risk transfer)
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** $H_1: p_X < p_Y$ (proportion of oil companies employing risk transfer < proportion of construction companies employing risk transfer)

- To test if the proportion of oil companies employing risk transfer is less than proportion of construction companies doing so, we need to conduct a hypothesis test.
  
- The next steps would involve setting up the test statistic, determining the critical value or p-value, comparing the test statistic to the critical value or p-value, and making a conclusion regarding the hypotheses.

- Based on the given information and statistical analysis, we cannot directly conclude whether the proportion of oil companies employing risk transfer methods is significantly less than that of construction companies; a formal hypothesis test is required for a more conclusive result.

#### Concepts:
- Sample sizes: $n_X=43$ and $n_Y=93$
- Population proportions: $p_X$ for oil companies and $p_Y$ for industrial companies
- Null hypothesis ($H_0$) and alternate hypothesis ($H_1$):
    - $H_0: p_X - p_Y \ge 0$ 
    - $H_1: p_X - p_Y < 0$
- Test statistic: $\hat{p}_X - \hat{p}_Y$
- Null distribution of $\hat{p}_X - \hat{p}_Y$ 
- Pooled proportion: $\hat{p} = \frac{22+55}{43+93} = 0.5662$
- Null distribution mean and standard deviation
- Observed value of $\hat{p}_X - \hat{p}_Y$
- Calculating z-score: $z = \frac{\text{Observed value} - 0}{\text{Standard deviation}}$
- P-value determination
- Conclusion based on the P-value: Can or cannot conclude the difference in proportions
- Computer output interpretation

- Number of Hispanic-American HIV-positive smokers who used nicotine patch, x1 = 20,

To test if the proportion of patch users is greater among European-Americans:
- Set up hypotheses:

#### 2. Health Effects of Exposure to Water-Damaged Homes

Given:
- Sample size of residents who participated in cleaning in Orleans Parish, n1 = 365,
- Number of residents who experienced symptoms of wheezing, x1 = 77,
- Sample size of residents who did not participate in cleaning in Orleans Parish, n2 = 179.

The health effects of exposure to water-damaged homes can be analyzed through comparing the proportions of residents with and without symptoms of wheezing:
- Calculate the sample proportion for each group:
  - $\hat{p}_1 = \frac{x1}{n1}$
  - $\hat{p}_2 = \frac{x2}{n2}$
- Perform a hypothesis test to determine if there is a significant difference in the proportions of residents experiencing symptoms of wheezing based on participation in cleaning activities.

In the study on the association of colonoscopy and death from colorectal cancer, a sample of 10,292 people diagnosed with colorectal cancer was analyzed. The study reported that 7.0% of these individuals had previously undergone a colonoscopy.

#### Comparing Percentage of Colonoscopies
In a sample of 51,460 people without colorectal cancer, 9.8% had previously had a colonoscopy. To determine if the percentage of people who have had colonoscopies is greater in those without colorectal cancer, we need more information such as the percentage of people with colorectal cancer who have had a colonoscopy.

#### Comparing Proportion of Falls
In a study of patients with Parkinson's disease, 76 out of 164 patients who exercised regularly reported falling in the previous six months, while 48 out of 96 patients who did not exercise regularly reported falling. To conclude whether the proportion of patients who fall is less for those who exercise than for those who do not, a statistical test comparing the rates of falling between the two groups would be necessary.

#### Calves with lesions
Let $p_1$ be the proportion of calves less than 4 days old with lesions and $p_2$ be the proportion of calves more than 4 days old with lesions.  
$H_0: p_1 = p_2$  
$H_a: p_1 \neq p_2$

Calculate the test statistic and p-value and compare the p-value to the significance level.

#### Overweight children
Let $p_1$ be the proportion of overweight boys aged 6-11 and $p_2$ be the proportion of overweight girls aged 6-11.

#### Proportion of Overweight Boys vs. Girls
Given a sample of 500 married couples, where 62% of husbands and 54% of wives found a new remote control easier to locate than their old one, let $p_1$ be the proportion of married men who find the new remote control easier to find, and $p_2$ be the proportion of married women who find it easier to find. To test if the proportion of overweight boys differs from the proportion of overweight girls, we can use the statistic $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 = 0.62 - 0.54$ to test the null hypothesis $H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0$ versus the alternative hypothesis $H_1: p_1 - p_2 \neq 0$.

#### Test and CI for Two Proportions

  - (a) 73
  - (b) 49
  - (c) 1.83
  - (d) 0.033

#### Two Means

The t-test can be used with small sample sizes when the Central Limit Theorem does not apply.

In the experiment described, the t-test is used to compare means of molecule counts with and without an enzyme that digests a specific sequence of nucleotides.

If the mean count is lower with the enzyme present, then it can be concluded the molecules contain the sequence.

Given counts without the enzyme as 33, 30, 26, 22, 37, and 34, a t-test can determine if the enzyme significantly affects the count.

#### Hypothesis Test for Means with Enzyme Presence

The hypothesis test compares the mean counts obtained with and without the enzyme present. Let $X_1, ..., X_6$ represent counts without the enzyme, and $Y_1, ..., Y_4$ represent counts with the enzyme. The null and alternate hypotheses are:

$H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \leq 0$  
$H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y > 0$

To perform the test, calculate the quantity:

$\displaystyle \frac{(X - Y) - (\mu_X - \mu_Y)}{\sqrt{ \frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y}}} $

This follows an approximate Student's t-distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom, where $\nu = \left( \frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y} \right)^2 \div \left( \frac{s_X^2}{n_X} \right)^2 (n_X - 1) + \left( \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y} \right)$.

#### Conclusion
Perform the hypothesis test using the calculated statistic to determine if the counts are significantly lower with the enzyme present.

#### Concepts:

The test statistic for the difference between two means is calculated as:

$$t = \frac{(\bar{X} - \bar{Y}) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y}}}$$

Under the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = 0$, the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution with degrees of freedom given by:

$$\nu = \frac{(\frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y})^2}{\frac{(\frac{s_X^2}{n_X})^2}{n_X-1} + \frac{(\frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y})^2}{n_Y-1}}$$

In this specific case, the calculated test statistic is $t = 2.038$. Referring to the t-table with 7 degrees of freedom, the critical values for a 5% cutoff are 1.895 and for a 2.5% cutoff are 2.365. The resultant P-value falls between 0.025 and 0.05 indicating a significant difference in means.

#### Enzyme Presence
Enzymes are essential biological molecules that catalyze various chemical reactions in living organisms.

#### Student's t Distribution
The null distribution in hypothesis testing that follows the Student's t distribution with a specified degrees of freedom.

#### Hypothesis Testing Example
In a study comparing item recognition between two website designs, hypothesis testing is conducted to determine if the mean number of items identified is greater with the new structured design.

#### Sample Mean Calculation

Given:
- Structured Web design: $\bar{X} = 32.3$, $s_X = 10.09$, $n_X = 10$
- Conventional Web design: $\bar{Y} = 32.3$, $s_Y = 8.56$, $n_Y = 10$

#### Hypotheses

$H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \leq 0$ vs $H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y > 0$

#### Test Statistic

$t = \frac{(\bar{X} - \bar{Y}) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y}}}$

#### Test Statistic Value

$t = 2.820$

#### Degrees of Freedom

$\nu = \left( \frac{10.09^2}{10} + \frac{8.56^2}{10} \right)^2 / \left( \left(\frac{10.09}{10}\right)^2 \times 9 + \left(\frac{8.56}{10}\right)^2 \times 9 \right) = 17.53 \approx 17$

#### Critical Values

At 1% level: $t_{\text{critical}} = 2.567$
At 0.5% level: $t_{\text{critical}} = 2.898$

#### Two-Sample T-Test Analysis

- The P-value is between $0.005$ and $0.01$, indicating strong evidence that the mean number of items identified is greater for the new design.

#### MINITAB Computer Output

- **Struct Group**: Mean = 44.10, Standard Deviation = 10.09
- **Conven Group**: Mean = 32.30, Standard Deviation = 8.56
- Estimated difference in means: $11.8000$
- 95% lower bound for difference: $4.52100$
- T-Test: T-Value = $2.82$, P-Value = $0.006$, Degrees of Freedom = $17$

#### Confidence Interval and Significance

- The 95% lower confidence bound supports the alternate hypothesis, indicating a P-value less than $5%$.

#### Testing Hypothesis for Difference Between Two Population Means

We can use a hypothesis test to determine if two population means differ by a specified constant. 

- Given null and alternative hypotheses: 
$H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \leq 2$ 
$H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y > 2$

- Test statistic for the hypothesis test:
$t = \frac{(X - Y) - 2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y}}}$

- Under the null hypothesis ($H_0$), the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution with degrees of freedom calculated similar to Example 6.12.

- Given observed data: $X=44.1$, $Y=32.3$, $s_X=10.09$, $s_Y=8.56$, $n_X=10$, $n_Y=10$.

- Calculated test statistic value: $t = 2.342$ for a one-tailed test.

- The P-value falls between 0.01 and 0.025.

#### Conclusion

Based on the results, we can conclude that the mean number of items identified with the new structured design exceeds that of the conventional design by more than 2.

#### Summary

Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ and $Y_1, ..., Y_n$ be samples from normal populations with means $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$ and standard deviations $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$, respectively. Assume the samples are drawn independently of each other.

If $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ are not known to be equal, then, to test a null hypothesis of the form:
- $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \leq \Delta_1$
- $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \geq \Delta_1$
- $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \neq \Delta_1$

1. Compute $\nu = \left[\frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y}\right]^2 \Big/ \left[\frac{s_X^2}{n_X}\right]^2/(n_X-1) + \left[\frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y}\right]^2/(n_Y-1)$, rounded down to the nearest integer.
2. Compute the test statistic $t = \frac{(\bar{X} - \bar{Y}) - \Delta_1}{\sqrt{s_X^2/n_X + s_Y^2/n_Y}}$.
3. Compute the P-value. The P-value is an area under the Student's t-curve with $\nu$ degrees of freedom, which depends on the alternate hypothesis as follows:

| Alternate Hypothesis       | P-value                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| $H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y > \Delta_1$ | Area to the right of $t$    |
| $H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y < \Delta_1$ | Area to the left of $t$     |
| $H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y \neq \Delta_1$| Sum of the areas in the tails cut off by $t$ and $-t$ |

#### When the Populations Have Equal Variances

When the populations have equal variances ($\sigma_X = \sigma_Y = \sigma$), additional considerations need to be taken into account.

#### Pooled Variance Formula
The pooled variance formula when population variances are nearly equal is given by:

$ s^2_p = \frac{(n_X - 1)s^2_X + (n_Y - 1)s^2_Y}{n_X + n_Y - 2} $

#### Test Statistic for Hypothesis Testing
The test statistic for testing hypotheses like $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = 0$, $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \leq 0$, or $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y \geq 0$ is:

$ t = \frac{X - Y}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_X} + \frac{1}{n_Y}}} $

#### Distribution of Test Statistic
Under $H_0$, the test statistic follows a Student’s t-distribution with $n_X + n_Y - 2$ degrees of freedom. 

#### Example: Nickel Content of Steel
In a specific example comparing two methods to determine the nickel content of steel, these concepts can be applied to test if there is a significant difference in mean measurements between the two methods.

#### Pooled Standard Deviation (sp)
$$sp = 0.0457$$

#### Test Statistic (t)
$$t = -2.990$$

#### Degrees of Freedom (df)
Under $H_0$: df = 10

#### P-Value
$$0.01 < P < 0.02$$

#### Conclusion
There appears to be a difference in the mean measurements between the two methods.

#### Pooled Variance Issue

The assumption of equal population variances for a pooled variance test is strict and can lead to unreliable results when not met.

#### Sample Variances vs Population Variances

Sample variances being nearly equal does not necessarily mean population variances are also equal. It's best to assume unequal variances unless certain they are equal.

#### Summary

Given samples $X_1, ..., X_n$ and $Y_1, ..., Y_n$ from normal populations with means $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$ and standard deviations $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ respectively, with samples drawn independently:

- If $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ are known to be equal:
  - Compute $s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_X-1)s_X^2 + (n_Y-1)s_Y^2}{n_X+n_Y-2}}$.
  - Compute the test statistic $t = \frac{(\bar{X}-\bar{Y}) - \Delta_0}{s_p \sqrt{1/n_X + 1/n_Y}}$.
  - Compute the P-value based on the alternate hypothesis.

- Treatment group (slow-release fertilizer): $25.2, 23.2, 25.2, 26.2, 25.0, 25.5, 25.2, 24.1, 24.8, 23.6$

To determine if the mean height of plants grown with slow-release fertilizer is greater than that of plants with usual fertilizer, we need to conduct a statistical test, such as a two-sample t-test.

#### Weights Comparison

Given 100 g object weights:
- First weight: $53$, $88$, $89$, $62$, $39$, $66$
- Second weight: $23$, $39$, $28$, $2$, $49$

Since variances do not depend on the object being weighed, we can test if the weights differ.

- New Process: $51$, $52$, $55$, $53$, $54$, $53$
- Old Process: $50$, $54$, $59$, $56$, $50$, $58$

To determine if the mean cost of the new method is less than that of the old method, we can perform a statistical test.

#### Given Information
- In the winter: $\mu_{1} = 0.51$, $n_{1} = 20$
- In the spring: $\mu_{2} = 0.62$, $n_{2} = 14$
- Standard deviation: $\sigma = 0.09$

- **Panel with 6-inch nail spacing:**
  - Mean failure pressure: $9.83$ kPa
  - Standard deviation: $1.02$ kPa

*Hypothesis Testing:*
- **Null Hypothesis $H_0$:** $\mu_{\text{8-inch}} \leq \mu_{\text{6-inch}}$
- **Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$:** $\mu_{\text{8-inch}} < \mu_{\text{6-inch}}$

*Conclusion:*
- Perform a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in mean iron oxide content between limenite grain and limenite lamella specimens.

#### Oxide Content Difference Between Limenite Grain and Limenite Lamella

When comparing the oxide content between limenite grain and limenite lamella, it is important to note that **limenite grain** typically has a higher concentration of oxides compared to **limenite lamella**. This difference in oxide content can significantly impact the properties and characteristics of the two structures.

#### Comparison of Mean Load at Failure for Rounded and Double-Rounded Dovetail Connections

To determine whether the mean load at failure is greater for rounded connections than for double-rounded connections, we can perform a hypothesis test. Specifically, we can conduct a **two-sample t-test** to compare the means of the two groups based on the provided data.

In this case, the **null hypothesis** would be that there is no difference in the mean load at failure between rounded and double-rounded connections, while the **alternative hypothesis** would be that the mean load at failure is greater for rounded connections.

#### Effectiveness of Variance Reduction Techniques

The study on **variance reduction techniques** aims to assess the effectiveness of different methods in reducing the variance associated with a single system. By comparing and analyzing these techniques, researchers can determine which approach is most successful in achieving variance reduction.

This analysis involves evaluating the **experimental results** obtained using various techniques and assessing how well each method performs in terms of reducing variance within the system. The **efficiency** and **reliability** of these techniques are crucial factors to consider when selecting the most appropriate variance reduction technique.

#### Tests with Paired Data

- Paired data analysis involves testing hypotheses on the basis of differences between paired observations from two samples.

#### Hypothesis Test for Mean Emissions Levels
The hypothesis test is used to determine if the mean level of emissions is lower for highway driving compared to stop-and-go driving.

Let $\mu_D$ be the population mean of the differences and $\sigma_D$ be the standard deviation. With only 8 differences in the sample, we use Student's t-test for small samples when assuming the population differences are normally distributed.

The observed sample mean is $D = 190.5$ and the sample standard deviation is $s_D = 284.1$. This data will be used to conduct the hypothesis test.

#### Paired T-Test Hypotheses
$H_0: \mu_D \leq 0$ vs $H_1: \mu_D > 0$

#### Test Statistic
$t = \frac{D - 0}{s_D/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{190.5 - 0}{284.1/\sqrt{8}} = 1.897$

#### Null Distribution
The null distribution of the test statistic is Student’s t with seven degrees of freedom.

#### P-Value and Conclusion
The P-value is approximately 0.05. The observed value of the test statistic (1.897) closely corresponds to the critical t-value of 1.895. The computed P-value is approximately 0.05.

#### Computer Output
```
T-Test of mean difference = 0 (vs > 0):
T-Value = 1.90
P-Value = 0.050
```

#### Important Concepts in Hypothesis Testing

Given a sample (X1, Y1), ..., (Xn, Yn) with differences D1, ..., Dn from a normal population with mean μD and sample standard deviation sD:

- **Test statistic calculation**: 
    $t = \frac{D - \mu_0}{s_D / \sqrt{n}}$

- **P-value computation**: 
    - The P-value is the area under the Student’s t curve with n-1 degrees of freedom.
    - It depends on the alternate hypothesis:
        - $H_1: \mu_D > \mu_0$ → Area to the right of t
        - $H_1: \mu_D < \mu_0$ → Area to the left of t
        - $H_1: \mu_D \neq \mu_0$ → ?? (Additional information needed)

#### Interpretation

- A very close P-value to 0.05 suggests that the lower bound of a 95% confidence interval is just barely consistent with the alternate hypothesis.

#### Hypothesis Testing for Mean Difference

Given sample data for brand name and generic drug amounts absorbed, we want to test if the mean absorbed amounts differ.

- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: Mean difference between brand name and generic drug absorbed amounts is zero.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**: Mean difference between brand name and generic drug absorbed amounts is not zero.

#### Test Statistic

The test statistic is calculated as:

$$ z = \frac{\bar{D} - \mu_0}{s_D / \sqrt{n}} $$

- $\mu_0 = 0$ (from the null hypothesis)
- $s_D$: Sample standard deviation of the differences
- $\bar{D}$: Sample mean of the differences
- $n$: Number of paired observations

#### Conclusion

Perform a z-test to determine if the mean absorbed amounts differ between the brand name and generic drug based on the calculated test statistic $z$.

#### Tests with Paired Data

To compare two methods of measuring mean arterial blood pressure, we can use paired data analysis. The differences between the two methods are calculated and analyzed to determine if there is a significant difference.

$92.9 - 86.3 = 6.6$

$101.5 - 97.3 = 4.2$

$74.3 - 79.8 = -5.5$

$95.0 - 98.1 = -3.1$

$91.4 - 82.1 = 9.3$

$80.6 - 84.5 = -3.9$

#### Conclusion on Mean Reading

To determine if the mean reading is greater for the auscultatory method, we can perform a hypothesis test on the paired differences. If the mean difference is significantly greater than 0, we can conclude that the mean reading is greater for the auscultatory method.

#### Uniformity of Etching

To study the uniformity of the etching process across the silicon wafers, the engineer can analyze the variation in etching depths at different locations on the wafers. Statistical techniques such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) can be used to assess the uniformity of the etching process.

#### Wafer Etch Rates Analysis

The etch rates at the center and edge of the wafer were measured for 10 wafers. Let's denote the etch rates at the center as $C$ and at the edge as $E$. We want to determine if the etch rates differ between the center and the edge.

Given data:
- Center etch rates: $ \{586, 568, 587, 550, 543, 552, 562, 577, 558, 571\}$
- Edge etch rates: $ \{582, 569, 587, 543, 540, 548, 563, 572, 559, 566\}$

To test if the etch rates differ, we can perform a paired t-test or simply calculate the mean etch rates for the two sites and compare them.

#### Diesel Truck Emissions Analysis

Emissions of NOx in ppm were recorded for 10 trucks at temperatures of 40°F and 80°F. Let's denote the emissions at 40°F as $E_{40}$ and at 80°F as $E_{80}$. We aim to determine if the mean emissions differ between the two temperatures.

Given data:
- Emissions at 40°F: $ \{0.8347, 0.7532, 0.8557, 0.9012, 0.7854, 0.8629, 0.8827, 0.7403, 0.7480, 0.8486\}$
- Emissions at 80°F: $ \{0.8152, 0.7652, 0.8426, 0.7971, 0.7643, 0.8195, 0.7836, 0.6945, 0.7729, 0.7947\}$

To test if the mean emissions differ, we can perform a two-sample t-test or calculate the mean emissions for each temperature and compare them.

#### Corrosion Loss Testing

Using the provided data for corrosion loss in μm:

| Pipe | Formulation A | Formulation B |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 1    | 197           | 204           |
| 2    | 161           | 182           |
| 3    | 144           | 140           |
| 4    | 162           | 178           |
| 5    | 185           | 183           |
| 6    | 154           | 163           |
| 7    | 136           | 156           |
| 8    | 130           | 143           |

We can test if the mean corrosion differs between the two formulations.

#### Speed Comparison of Microprocessors

Given the times (in seconds) for each processor on six benchmark codes:

| Code | Processor A | Processor B |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1    | 27.2        | 24.1        |
| 2    | 18.1        | 19.3        |
| 3    | 27.2        | 26.8        |
| 4    | 19.7        | 20.1        |
| 5    | 24.5        | 27.6        |
| 6    | 22.1        | 29.8        |

We can test if the mean speeds of the two processors differ.

#### 1. Mean Strength After Three Days vs. Six Days

Given data:

- Mean strength after 3 days: $ \bar{x_{3}} = \frac{1341 + 1316 + 1352 + 1355 + 1327}{5} = 1338.2 $
- Mean strength after 6 days: $ \bar{x_{6}} = \frac{1376 + 1373 + 1366 + 1384 + 1358}{5} = 1371.4 $

Conclusion: The mean strength after six days ($ \bar{x_{6}} = 1371.4 $) is greater than the mean strength after three days ($ \bar{x_{3}} = 1338.2 $).

#### 2. Mean Deflection for Boeing 747 vs. Boeing 777

Given data:

- Mean deflection for Boeing 747: $ \bar{x_{747}} = \frac{4.01 + 3.87 + 3.72 + 3.76}{4} = 3.84 $
- Mean deflection for Boeing 777: $ \bar{x_{777}} = \frac{4.57 + 4.48 + 4.36 + 4.43}{4} = 4.46 $

Conclusion: The mean deflection for Boeing 777 ($ \bar{x_{777}} = 4.46 $) is greater than the mean deflection for Boeing 747 ($ \bar{x_{747}} = 3.84 $).

#### Matched Pair Methods

$H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$

$H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$

#### Drug Comparison Example
- Drug A: $6,3,4,5,7,1,4$
- Drug B: $5,1,5,5,5,2,2$

#### Cholesterol Levels Example
a. $H_0: \mu_{after} - \mu_{before} \geq 0$

b. $H_a: \mu_{after} - \mu_{before} < 0$

#### Hypotheses and P-Value for Mean Cholesterol Level Reduction
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** $\mu \leq 75$ (Mean cholesterol reduction after treatment is less than or equal to 75 mg/dL)
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** $\mu > 75$ (Mean cholesterol reduction after treatment is greater than 75 mg/dL)
- **P-Value Calculation:** Conduct appropriate statistical tests to determine if the reduction in mean cholesterol level is significantly greater than 75 mg/dL.

#### Hypothesis Testing for Taxi Cab Tire Switch
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** There is no difference in fuel economy between radial and bias tires.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** There is an improvement in fuel economy with radial tires compared to bias tires.
- **P-Value Calculation:** Perform statistical analysis on the fuel economy data for the two tire types to assess if it is statistically significant to switch to radial tires for improved mileage.

#### Switch to Radial Tires

- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: mean mileage improvement by switching to radial tires $\leq$ 2 mpg

- **Alternate Hypothesis ($H_a$)**: mean mileage improvement by switching to radial tires > 2 mpg

- **P-value**: The P-value for the hypothesis test will help determine if there is enough evidence to switch to radial tires if the mean mileage improvement is greater than 2 mpg.

#### Hypothesis Test for $\mu_X - \mu_Y$

a. **Type of Test**: This is a one-tailed test.

b. **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: There is no difference between the population means ($\mu_X = \mu_Y$).

c. **Rejection at 1% Level**: The P-value is 0.038, which is less than a significance level of 0.01, so $H_0$ can be rejected at the 1% level.

d. **Confidence Interval**: Using the output and a table, a 98% confidence interval can be computed for $\mu_X - \mu_Y$.

#### Paired t-test for \(X - Y\)

Given data:

- \(n = 7\)
- \(X\): Mean = 12.4141, StDev = 2.9235, SE = (a)
- \(Y\): Mean = 8.3476, StDev is not provided, SE = 1.0764
- Difference: Mean = 3.16758, SE = 1.19723

95% lower bound for mean difference: 1.74006

T-Test of mean difference = 0 (vs > 0): 
- T-Value = (d)
- P-Value = 0.007

#### Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
$H_0: \mu \geq 12$  
$H_1: \mu < 12$

- The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test is used when the population is not normal and requires the population to be continuous and the probability density function to be symmetric.
- It does not assume normality, making it suitable for situations with outliers.
- The test is analogous to the two-sample t-test and is used to compare the means of two independent groups.

#### Population Symmetry Assumption
We assume the population is approximately symmetric when dealing with outliers on either side.

#### Rank-Sum Statistic Calculation
- $H_0$: Population mean ($\mu$) = 12, population median = 12
- Compute rank-sum statistic by subtracting 12 from each observation and assigning ranks based on the closest values to 0.

#### Rank Calculation
| $x$ | $x - 12$ | Rank |
|-----|---------|------|
| 11.5 | -0.5 | -1 |
| 13.9 | 1.9 | 2 |
| 9.3 | -2.7 | -3 |
| 9.0 | -3.0 | -4 |
| 21.7 | 9.7 | 5 |
| 0.9 | -11.1 | -6 |

#### Test Statistic Calculation
- Sum of positive ranks ($S+$) = 2 + 5 = 7
- Sum of absolute values of negative ranks ($S-$) = 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 14
- Use $S+$ as the test statistic for this example.

#### Distribution-Free Tests

$S_{+} + S_{-} = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$

$S_{+} + S_{-} = 1 + 2 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

In some cases, compute $S_{-}$ by summing negative ranks and then $S_{+} = n(n+1)/2 - S_{-}$.

In Figure 6.17, if $\mu > 12$, positive ranks are more probable and tend to be larger, leading to a large $S_{+}$.

In Figure 6.18, if $\mu < 12$, positive ranks are fewer and smaller, resulting in a small $S_{+}$.

#### Key Concepts:

- True median is less than 12.
- Sample observations more likely to be below 12 than above 12.
- Observations below 12 tend to have larger differences from 12 than above 12.
- Large values of $S^+$ provide evidence against $H_0: \mu \leq \mu_0$.
- Small values of $S^+$ provide evidence against $H_0: \mu \geq \mu_0$.
- In this case, $H_0: \mu \geq 12$, so small $S^+$ provides evidence against $H_0$.
- Observed $S^+ = 7$.
- P-value is the probability of observing a value of $S^+$ that is less than or equal to 7 when $H_0$ is true.

#### Null Distribution of S+
Given a sample size of $n=6$, if the observed value of S+ is 19. The null distribution of S+ is consulted to find the probability of observing a value of 4 or less to be 0.1094. Since the observed value is greater than this, the conclusion is to not reject H0.

#### Testing Hypotheses
In the given example with nickel content data for six welds, the null hypothesis is $H_0: \mu \leq 5$ versus $H_1: \mu > 5$. The signed ranks and differences are calculated to determine the test statistic S+ which turns out to be 19. The P-value calculated based on the null distribution for this test is found to be 0.0469.

#### Test for $H_0: \mu = 16$ versus $H_1: \mu \neq 16$

The observed value of the test statistic for the two-tailed test is $S^+ = 3$. 

From Table A.5, the area in the left-hand tail is 0.0781. 

Therefore, the two-tailed P-value is $2(0.0781) = 0.1562$.

#### Ties

When quantities have the same value, they are considered tied. 

The standard method for dealing with ties is to assign the average rank for tied observations.

#### Ranks and Differences

If the mean under $H_0$ is $\mu_0$, and one of the observations is equal to $\mu_0$, then its difference is 0. An observation equal to $\mu_0$ cannot receive a signed rank. Remove such observations and adjust the sample size accordingly.

#### Example 6.17

**Given Data:**  
- Hypotheses: $H_0: \mu = 9$ vs $H_1: \mu \neq 9$
- Differences and Signed Ranks:
    - 9.0 (0.0) -
    - 9.3 (0.3) 1
    - 11.5 (2.5) 2
    - 13.9 (4.9) 3
    - 0.9 (-8.1) -4
    - 21.7 (12.7) 5

**Test Statistic:**  
- $S^+ = 11$
- Adjusted sample size: 5 (excluding 9.0)

**Conclusion:**  
- $P$-value with $S^+ = 12$: $2(0.1562) = 0.3124$

#### Large-Sample Approximation
When $S^+ >= 11, P > 0.3124$, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test can be approximated using a normal distribution when the sample size $n$ is large. The test statistic $S^+$ has a mean of $\frac{n(n+1)}{4}$ and a variance of $\frac{n(n+1)(2n +1)}{24}$ under the null hypothesis $H_0$. The z-score for $S^+$ is calculated as:
$$ z = \frac{S^+ - \frac{n(n+1)}{4}}{\sqrt{\frac{n(n+1)(2n +1)}{24}}} $$

#### Example 6.18
In a study evaluating a reorder point policy for inventory restocking, costs for 32 scenarios were estimated. Let $\mu$ represent the mean cost. A hypothesis test is conducted with $H_0: \mu \geq 70$ versus $H_1: \mu < 70$.

#### Data for Example 6.18
$Signed \quad xx \quad -70 \quad Rank$

$79.26 \quad 9.26 \quad 1$

$80.79 \quad 10.79 \quad 2$

$\vdots$

$100.36 \quad 30.36 \quad 10$

$30.46 \quad -39.54 \quad -11$

#### Solution
For the given data:
- Sample size $n = 32$
- Mean $= \frac{n(n+1)}{4} = 264$
- Variance $= \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{24} = 2860$
- Sum of positive ranks $S^+ = 121$

Compute $z = \frac{121-264}{\sqrt{2860}} = -2.67$. 
Small values of $S^+$ provide evidence against $H_0: \mu \geq \mu_0$. P-value is the area under the normal distribution curve.

#### Left-Tailed Test
The left-tailed test involves determining the area to the left of $z = -2.67$, resulting in a P-value of 0.0038.

#### The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test, also known as the Mann-Whitney test, is used to compare population means when populations are not normal. Two key assumptions are required: populations must be continuous, and their probability density functions must be identical in shape and size. 

We have two random samples, $X_1, ..., X_m$ and $Y_1, ..., Y_n$, with sample sizes $m$ and $n$, respectively. The test involves ordering the combined values from both samples.

#### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test

The test statistic $W$ is the sum of the ranks corresponding to $X_1, ..., X_m$. 

If $\mu_X < \mu_Y$, ranks in the $X$ sample will tend to be smaller, making $W$ smaller as well. 
If $\mu_X > \mu_Y$, $W$ will tend to be larger.

#### Example 6.19

Resistances (m/$\Omega$) measured for five wires of one type and six wires of another type:
- $X$: 3, 62, 82, 92, 0, 3, 8
- $Y$: 3, 44, 13, 54, 74, 94, 6

We assign ranks to the values:
```
Value | Rank | Sample | Value | Rank | Sample
---------------------------------------------
  3   |   1  |    X   |  38   |   7  |   X
 28   |   2  |    X   |  41   |   8  |   Y
 29   |   3  |    X   |  46   |   9  |   Y
 34   |   4  |    Y   |  47   |  10  |   Y
 35   |   5  |    Y   |  49   |  11  |   Y
 36   |   6  |    X   
```

The test statistic $W$ is the sum of ranks corresponding to $X$ values: $W = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 19$. 
To determine the P-value, consult the corresponding table.

#### Small Sample Size Test
$W \leq 19$

#### P-value Calculation
$P \text{-value} = 0.0260$

#### Large-Sample Approximation
$\text{mean} = \frac{m(m+n+1)}{2}$
$\text{variance} = \frac{mn(m+n+1)}{12}$

#### Z-score Calculation
$z = \frac{W - \frac{m(m+n+1)}{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{mn(m+n+1)}{12}}}$

#### Example 6.20
Illustrates the method of hypothesis testing

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test

Given data for 10 jobs bid by the traditional method (X) and 19 jobs bid by an experimental system (Y), with corresponding ranks:

- For X: $57, $457, $584
- For Y: $95, $101, $118, $149, $196, $200, $233, $243, $341, $419, $457, $592, $594, $613, $622, $708, $726, $843, $908, $926, $943, $1048, $1165, $1293, $1593, $1952, $2424

The sum of the X ranks is 188. With sample sizes $m=10$ and $n=19$, using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test we compute $z=1.74$.

Large values of W provide evidence against the null hypothesis. The P-value is 0.0409, indicating significance.

#### Distribution-Free Tests

Distribution-free methods are not assumption-free. These methods have certain assumptions for validity. While they can be useful when traditional methods like the Student's t-test are not justified, they still require assumptions like symmetry for the signed-rank test and identical shapes/spreads for the rank-sum test.

#### 6. Hydroconversion rates study

In the study of "n-Nonane Hydroconversion on Ni and Pt Containing HMFI, HMOR and HBEA", hydroconversion rates (in μmol/g ·s) of n-nonane over HMFI and HBEA catalysts were presented.

#### HMFI and HBEA Catalysts Comparison

The mean rate for HMFI catalyst: $\bar{x} = 3.58$

The mean rate for HBEA catalyst: $\bar{y} = 1.65$

As the mean rates differ significantly between the two catalysts, we can conclude that the mean rate differs between HMFI and HBEA catalysts.

#### New Postsurgical Treatment Comparison

Mean recovery time for treatment group X: $\bar{x} = 18.57$

Mean compressive strength for blocks cured 2 days (X): $\bar{x} = 1309.07 \, \text{MPa}$

Mean compressive strength for blocks cured 6 days (Y): $\bar{y} = 1372.4 \, \text{MPa}$

Based on the mean compressive strengths, we can conclude that the mean rate differs between blocks cured for 2 days and blocks cured for 6 days.

#### Hypothesis Testing for Mean Strength of Blocks Cured for Six Days

Given data:
- $1378 \: 1343 \: 1349 \: 1321 \: 1364 \: 1332 \: 1396 \: 1372 \: 1341 \: 1374$

Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): The mean strength is the same for blocks cured for six days.
Alternate Hypothesis ($H_1$): The mean strength is greater for blocks cured for six days.

#### Hypothesis Testing for Mean Score Difference Between Online and Classroom Courses

- Classroom: $80 \: 83 \: 64 \: 81 \: 75 \: 80 \: 86 \: 81 \: 51 \: 64 \: 59 \: 85 \: 74 \: 77$

Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): The mean score is the same for both types of courses.
Alternate Hypothesis ($H_1$): The mean score differs between online and classroom courses.

#### Hypothesis Testing for Shorter Average Driving Time Between Route A and Route B

- Route B: $17.2 \: 16.9 \: 16.1 \: 19.8 \: 16.7$

Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): The mean time is the same for both routes.
Alternate Hypothesis ($H_1$): The mean time is less for route A.


#### Bernoulli Trial
A process with two possible outcomes, "success" and "failure", with success probability $p$. Null hypothesis tests can be conducted comparing observed success rate to a specified value.

#### Two Sets of Bernoulli Trials
Comparing success probabilities of two sets of Bernoulli trials, testing the null hypothesis that $p_1 = p_2$.

#### Multinomial Trial
An experiment with k outcomes where k ≥ 2, each outcome with a probability denoted by $p_1, ..., p_k$. Generalization of Bernoulli trials. Example: rolling a fair die with six outcomes and equal probabilities.

#### Tests for Multinomial Trials
Generalizing tests for Bernoulli probabilities to multinomial trials.

#### Null Hypothesis Testing for Multinomial Probabilities

$H_0: p_1 = p_{01}, p_2 = p_{02}, ..., p_k = p_{0k}$

#### Fairness Testing for a Die

$H_0: p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = p_4 = p_5 = p_6 = \frac{1}{6}$

#### Construction of Expected Values

- Total number of trials: $N = 600$
- Observed values are the results obtained in the experiment
- Expected values are the mean number of trials for each outcome under the null hypothesis

#### Chi-Square Statistic
The chi-square statistic is used in hypothesis testing to measure the closeness of observed values to expected values.

The formula for the chi-square statistic is:
$$ \chi^2 = \frac{k}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}} $$

Where:
- $k$ is the number of outcomes
- $O_i$ is the observed number of trials for outcome $i$
- $E_i$ is the expected number of trials for outcome $i$

In a hypothesis test, if $H_0$ is true, the observed and expected values are expected to be close to each other.

#### Chi-Squared Test Statistic ($\chi^2$):
- The larger the value of $\chi^2$, the stronger the evidence against $H_0$.
- P-value for the test is determined by the null distribution of the test statistic.
- Null distribution approximated by the chi-square distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom ($\chi^2_{k-1}$).

#### Chi-Square Distribution:
- Degrees of freedom: $k-1$ (number of categories - 1).
- Appropriate when all expected values are greater than or equal to 5.

#### Chi-Square Distribution Table:
- Provides values for quantiles for various degrees of freedom.
- Use table to find upper percentage points for calculations.

#### Additional Information:
- Refer to "Table A.7" in Appendix A for chi-square distribution values.
- Probability density function of $\chi^2_{10}$ distribution example in Figure 6.19.

#### Chi-Square Statistic Calculation
The chi-square statistic is calculated using the formula:
$$\chi^2=\sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$
For the given data with degrees of freedom 5, the chi-square statistic is:
$$\chi^2 = 6.12$$

#### P-Value Determination
To determine the P-value for the test statistic, check the chi-square table for 5 degrees of freedom:
- The upper 10% point is 9.236.
- Since the calculated chi-square value of 6.12 is less than this, P > 0.10.
- Thus, there is no evidence to suggest that the die is not fair.

#### Probability Density Function of the $\chi^2$ Distribution

The probability density function of the $\chi^2$ distribution is used to analyze the goodness-of-fit of a multinomial distribution to the data.

#### Test Statistic and P-Value

Given the observed test statistic of 6.12 and the upper 10% point of 9.236, the P-value is greater than 0.10, indicating significance.

#### Goodness-of-Fit Test

The described test determines how well a multinomial distribution fits the data, hence named a goodness-of-fit test.

#### Powerball Lottery Example

Investigating the fairness of the Powerball lottery based on observed frequencies and categories. The question poses a challenge regarding the fairness of the lottery.

#### Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity

$Under \ the \ null \ hypothesis, \ each \ draw \ has \ probability \ 1/5 \ to \ fall \ into \ each \ category.$\
$Each \ expected \ value \ is \ 137/5 = 27.4.$\
$Test \ statistic: \ \chi^{2} = \frac{(31-27.4)^{2}}{27.4} + \frac{(24-27.4)^{2}}{27.4} + \frac{(25-27.4)^{2}}{27.4} + \frac{(24-27.4)^{2}}{27.4} + \frac{(33-27.4)^{2}}{27.4} = 2.6715.$\
$Degrees \ of \ freedom: \ 5 \ categories \ implies \ 4 \ degrees \ of \ freedom.$\
$Chi-square \ table \ shows \ P>0.10. \ (P=0.61 \ from \ computer \ software).$\
$No \ evidence \ that \ the \ lottery \ is \ unfair.$

#### The Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity

$Null \ hypothesis: \ Probabilities \ of \ outcomes \ are \ the \ same \ for \ each \ experiment.$\
$In \ case \ of \ multiple \ multinomial \ trials \ with \ same \ set \ of \ outcomes.$\
$Example: \ Four \ machines \ manufacture \ cylindrical \ steel \ pins.$

#### Contingency Table for Pin Diameter Specification

A contingency table presents observed numbers of pins in various categories based on the diameter specification. Each row represents a category (e.g., machine), and each column represents another category (e.g., thickness).

$Total Count = 500$

- Machine 1:
  - Too Thin: 10
  - OK: 102
  - Too Thick: 8
- Machine 2:
  - Too Thin: 34
  - OK: 161
  - Too Thick: 5
- Machine 3:
  - Too Thin: 12
  - OK: 79
  - Too Thick: 9
- Machine 4:
  - Too Thin: 10
  - OK: 60
  - Too Thick: 10

#### Interpretation of Cell Values

- Observed value in cell $ij$: 
  - Number of trials with the outcome in the $i^{th}$ row category and $j^{th}$ column category.
  - Represents the count of pins falling into specific categories based on the diameter specification.

#### Marginal Totals
- Marginal totals are the totals of observed values for each row and column in a table.

#### Null Hypothesis
- The null hypothesis states that the proportion of pins that are too thin, OK, or too thick is the same for all machines.
- It suggests that regardless of the chosen row, the probabilities of outcomes associated with the columns are the same.

#### Notation and Test Statistic
- Let $I$ denote the number of rows in the table, and let $J$ denote the number of columns.
- Let $p_{ij}$ denote the probability that the outcome falls into column $j$ given it is in row $i$ under the null hypothesis.
- The null hypothesis can be expressed as:
  $$H_0: \text{For each column } j, p_{1j} = \ldots = p_{Ij}$$

#### Observed Values and Test Statistic Calculation
- Let $O_{ij}$ denote the observed value in cell $ij$ in the table.
- Let $O_{i.}$ denote the sum of observed values in row $i$, $O_{.j}$ denote the sum of observed values in column $j$, and $O_{..}$ denote the sum of observed values in all cells.

(Note: In complete markdown, please format the equations using the Latex notation for better readability.)

#### Expected Value Calculation

To compute the expected value for each cell in the table, use the formula:

$E_{ij} = \frac{O_{i.} \cdot O_{.j}}{O_{..}}$

#### Test Statistic

The test statistic $\chi^2$ is calculated based on the differences between observed and expected values:

$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{j=1}^{J} \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$

#### Chi-Square Test Under H0
- Test statistic: $\chi^2$
- Distribution: Chi-square with $(I-1)(J-1)$ degrees of freedom
- Appropriate use: Expected values >= 5

#### Example: Testing Proportions
- Null hypothesis: Proportions are the same for all machines
- Calculate expected values $E_{ij}$
- Verify all expected values are >= 5

#### Expected Values Table
|           | Too Thin | OK    | Too Thick | Total |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Machine 1 | 15.84    | 96.48 | 7.68      | 120.00|
| Machine 2 | 26.40    | 160.80| 12.80     | 200.00|
| Machine 3 | 13.20    | 80.40 | 6.40      | 100.00|
| Machine 4 | 10.56    | 64.32 | 5.12      | 80.00 |
| Total     | 66.00    | 402.00| 32.00     | 500.00|

#### Computation of Chi-Square Statistic 
The chi-square statistic is calculated using Equation (6.9):
$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(10-15.84)^2}{15.84} + \ldots + \frac{(10-5.12)^2}{5.12} = 15.5844
$$

#### Degrees of Freedom 
With four rows and three columns, the degrees of freedom is $(4-1)(3-1) = 6$.

#### P-Value Calculation 
By referring to the chi-square table for six degrees of freedom, we find the upper 1% point as 16.812. Thus, $0.01 < P < 0.025$.

#### Conclusion 
Based on the P-value range, it can be inferred that the machines differ in the proportions of pins that are too thin, OK, or too thick.

#### Observations 
The observed row and column totals are equal to the expected row and column totals in this case.

#### MINITAB Output
The MINITAB output displays the expected and observed counts for the Thin, OK, and Thick categories.

#### Chi-Square Test for Independence

The Chi-Square Test for Independence is used to test the null hypothesis that the probabilities of the column outcomes are the same for each row outcome. The test statistic, Chi-Squared ($\chi^2$), is calculated using the formula: $\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$, where $O_{ij}$ is the observed value, $E_{ij}$ is the expected value, and the summation is done over all cells.

In the output provided, each cell contains three numbers: the observed value, the expected value, and the contribution $\left(\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}\right)$ made to the Chi-Square statistic from that cell.

The Chi-Square statistic follows a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom (DF) equal to the product of the number of rows minus one and the number of columns minus one. The p-value is then derived to determine the statistical significance of the test.

#### Example 6.23

$O_{ij}$: Observed values for 1021 Steel Pins
$E_{ij}$: Expected values for 1021 Steel Pins
$H_0$: Proportions of pins do not depend on length speciﬁcation

Observed values:
$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc|c}
& \text{Thin} & \text{OK} & \text{Thick} & \text{Total} \\ 
\hline
\text{Too Short} & 13 & 117 & 4 & 134 \\
\text{OK} & 62 & 664 & 80 & 806 \\
\text{Too Long} & 5 & 68 & 8 & 81 \\
\text{Total} & 80 & 849 & 92 & 1021 \\
\end{array}
$$

Expected values:
$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc|c}
& \text{Thin} & \text{OK} & \text{Thick} & \text{Total} \\ 
\hline
\text{Too Short} & 7.85 & 82.9 & 9.25 & 100 \\
\text{OK} & 67.19 & 708.94 & 79.87 & 856 \\
\text{Too Long} & 5.96 & 63.16 & 7.12 & 76 \\
\text{Total} & 81 & 855 & 96 & 1032 \\
\end{array}
$$

#### Chi-Square Test

The chi-square test is appropriate when all expected values are greater than or equal to 5.

The chi-square statistic is computed using the formula:

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(\text{Too Short} - \text{Thin})^2}{\text{Thin}} + \ldots + \frac{(\text{Too Long} - \text{Thick})^2}{\text{Thick}} = 7.46
$$

#### Degrees of Freedom and P-Value

With three rows and three columns, the degrees of freedom are $(3-1)(3-1) = 4$.

Consulting the chi-square table for four degrees of freedom, the upper 10% point is 7.779. Since $P > 0.10$, there is no evidence of a relationship between length and thickness.

#### Hypotheses

$H_0$: The true percentages are 85% conforming, 10% downgraded, and 5% scrap.

#### Expected Values

Compute the expected values under the null hypothesis.

#### Chi-Square Statistic

Compute the value of the chi-square statistic.

#### P-Value

Find the P-value. Conclude based on the results.

#### Quality Variation

$H_0$: The quality of welds is the same across all shifts.

#### Expected Values

Compute the expected values under the null hypothesis.

#### Conclusion

Determine if there is a significant difference in quality among shifts.

#### Chi-Square Test for Independence

Given a contingency table with observed counts, we can conduct a chi-square test for independence to determine if there is a relationship between two categorical variables.

The steps involved are:

$a. Setup Hypotheses: \\
H_0: \text{There is no relationship between the variables} \\
H_1: \text{There is a relationship between the variables}$

$b. Calculate Expected Values: \\
\text{Find the expected counts for each cell in the table.}$

$c. Compute Chi-Square Statistic: \\
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} \\
\text{where } O \text{ is the observed count and } E \text{ is the expected count}$

$d. Find the P-value: \\
\text{Use the chi-square statistic to determine the P-value.}$

Based on the P-value, we can either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis and draw conclusions about the relationship between the variables.

#### Theoretical Model Analysis

Given the observed and expected values, we can use a goodness-of-fit test to determine if the theoretical model explains the observed values well. The chi-squared test can be used for this analysis.

The chi-squared test statistic is calculated as:

$$\chi^2 = \sum\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$

where \(O_i\) is the observed value and \(E_i\) is the expected value in each category. 

We can then compare the calculated chi-squared value to a critical value or p-value to determine if the theoretical model adequately explains the observed values.

#### Beryllium Exposure and Disease Status

To determine if the proportions of workers in different disease categories differ among exposure levels, we can perform a chi-squared test for independence on the provided data. 

The chi-squared test for independence checks if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. The test compares observed frequencies to expected frequencies under the null hypothesis of independence.

The test statistic is calculated as:

$$\chi^2 = \sum\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$$

where \(O_{ij}\) is the observed frequency and \(E_{ij}\) is the expected frequency in each cell of the contingency table.

By comparing the calculated chi-squared value to a critical value or p-value, we can determine if there is a significant difference in the proportions of workers in different disease categories among exposure levels.

#### Chi-Square Test for Independence

1. **Null Hypothesis**: The proportions of infants using various types of restraints do not differ with age

2. **Observed Values**:
    - Safety seat: $15$ $\quad$ $10$ $\quad$ $12$
    - Seat belt: $31$ $\quad$ $11$ $\quad$ $1$
    - No restraint: $91$ $\quad$ $41$ $\quad$ $2$

3. **Expected Values**:
    - To construct the table of expected values, calculate the expected value for each cell based on the row and column totals.

4. **Chi-Square Test Calculation**:
    - Calculate the chi-square statistic using the formula: $\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$

5. **Degrees of Freedom**: $(r-1) \times (c-1)$, where $r =$ number of rows and $c =$ number of columns

6. **Critical Value**: Compare the calculated chi-square statistic to the critical value from the chi-square distribution

7. **Conclusion**:
    - If calculated chi-square > critical value, reject the null hypothesis
    - If calculated chi-square < critical value, fail to reject the null hypothesis

8. **Decision**:
    - If null hypothesis is rejected, conclude that the proportions of infants using various types of restraints differ with age

#### Are the row and column outcomes independent?
The row and column outcomes are independent if the observed values in the table follow the expected values under the assumption of independence among rows and columns. 

#### Fill in the blank:
i. The row totals in the observed table must be the same as the row totals in the expected table, but the column totals need not be the same. 

ii. The column totals in the observed table must be the same as the column totals in the expected table, but the row totals need not be the same.

#### Possibility of constructing expected values table:
It is not possible to construct the corresponding table of expected values without any observed values. The expected values are calculated based on the observed values and deviations from expected values can't be determined without the observed values.


#### Observed Values

The observed values are:

$A: 2, 5$
$C: 4, 0$
$D: 7, 5$
$Total: 50, 20, —, 150$

#### Hypothesis Testing

In a sample of 200 plates:

- Premium: 19
- Conforming: 133
- Downgraded: 35
- Unacceptable: 13

The engineer claims proportions of 10%, 70%, 15%, and 5% for the categories. We need to test if the engineer's claim is incorrect.

### Shift Analysis

$H_0$: Proportions of workers with symptoms are the same across shifts.

$H_a$: Proportions of workers with symptoms differ across shifts.

Use chi-squared test to determine if there's significant difference in symptom distribution across shifts.

### False Alarms Analysis

$H_0$: Proportion of false alarms with known causes is the same each month.

$H_a$: Proportion of false alarms with known causes differs each month.

Use chi-squared test to assess if there's a difference in the proportion of false alarms with known causes monthly.

#### Concepts:
- **Alleles**: A, B, C for one genetic locus, and 1, 2, 3 for another locus.
- **Haplotypes**: Combinations of alleles at two loci, with nine possible haplotypes: A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3.
- **Linkage Equilibrium**: Two alleles in an individual's haplotype are independent.
- **Chi-Square Test for Independence**: Testing independence of alleles at both loci.
- **MINITAB Output**:
  - Observed counts and Chi-Square contributions for different combinations of alleles.
  - Chi-Square value, degrees of freedom (DF), and P-Value for the test.

#### Solutions:
a. $B3 = 78$ individuals were observed to have this haplotype.

b. The question is incomplete.

#### Expected number of individuals with haplotype A2: 

The expected number of individuals with haplotype A2 can be calculated using the formula:

$\text{Expected count of A2} = \sum_{i=1}^{9} \text{(frequency of haplotype i) } \times \text{(probability of A2 in haplotype i)}$

#### Least frequently observed haplotype: 

Identify the haplotype with the lowest frequency among the nine haplotypes.

#### Haplotype with the smallest expected count: 

Calculate the expected count for each haplotype and identify the one with the smallest value.

#### Linkage equilibrium: 

To determine if the loci are in linkage equilibrium, check if the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies based on independence of loci.

#### Linkage disequilibrium: 

If the observed frequencies significantly differ from the expected frequencies assuming independence, the loci are likely in linkage disequilibrium.

#### Null Hypotheses Forms
- $H_0: \sigma^2 \leq \sigma_0^2$
- $H_0: \sigma^2 \geq \sigma_0^2$
- $H_0: \sigma^2 = \sigma_0^2$

#### Chi-Square Distribution
- When $H_0$ is true ($\sigma^2=\sigma_0^2$), the test statistic follows a chi-square distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

#### Example: Check Reliability of Scale
- Given: Test weight known to weigh 400 grams was weighed 16 times with a required variance of less than 1.
- Sample Variance: $s^2 = 0.81$
- Null Hypothesis: $H_0: \sigma \geq 1, H_1: \sigma < 1$
- Test Statistic: $(n-1)s^2 = 12.15$
- Conclusion: The smaller the test statistic value, the stronger the evidence against $H_0$.

#### Key Concepts in Hypothesis Testing

- **P-value Calculation**: The P-value is the probability of observing a test statistic value less than or equal to the observed value under the assumption that $H_0$ is true.

- **Interpreting P-value**: Consulting the chi-square table with appropriate degrees of freedom, comparing the observed test statistic to the critical value allows us to determine if the P-value is greater than a significance level, often 0.10 in this case.

- **Reliability Assessment**: Based on the P-value and significance level, we can determine if there is enough evidence to reject $H_0$. In this case, the conclusion is that the scale is not reliable.

- **Test Statistic Interpretation**: For null hypotheses in the form $H_0: \sigma^2 \leq \sigma_0^2$, larger values of the test statistic provide stronger evidence against $H_0$.

- **P-value Direction**: The P-value is the area to the right of the observed test statistic value when testing hypotheses like $H_0: \sigma^2 = \sigma_0^2$, indicating whether the observed data is significantly different from the hypothesized value.

#### Evidence against $H_0$

- When conducting hypothesis testing, it is important to gather evidence against the null hypothesis, denoted as $H_0$.
- The p-value is calculated to determine the strength of the evidence against $H_0$, with a lower p-value indicating stronger evidence. 

#### The F Test for Equality of Variance

- The F Test is used to test the null hypothesis that two populations have equal variances.
- This test is suitable when both populations are normally distributed.
  
#### Hypotheses for F Test

Three possible null hypotheses for testing variances:
1. $H_0: \sigma_{1}^2 \leq \sigma_{2}^2$ (or equivalently, $\sigma_{1} \leq \sigma_{2}$)
2. $H_0: \sigma_{1}^2 \geq \sigma_{2}^2$ (or equivalently, $\sigma_{1} \geq \sigma_{2}$)
3. $H_0: \sigma_{1}^2 = \sigma_{2}^2$

#### Testing Hypotheses About Variances of Normal Populations

- Null Hypothesis: $H_0: \sigma_1^2 / \sigma_2^2 \leq 1$ or equivalently, $\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$
- Alternative Hypothesis: $H_1: \sigma_1^2 / \sigma_2^2 > 1$

##### Test Statistic

- $F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}$

##### Interpretation

- When $H_0$ is true (i.e., $\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$), the expected value of $F$ is close to 1.
- When $H_0$ is false, $\sigma_1^2 > \sigma_2^2$, leading to $F > 1$.

##### F-Distribution

- Represents the null distribution of the test statistic $F$.
- Based on ratios of quantities, indicating the variability between sample variances.

#### F-Distribution

The F-distribution is used to compare the variances of two sample populations. It has two sets of degrees of freedom - one for the numerator and one for the denominator, denoted as F_{\nu_1, \nu_2}. The degrees of freedom for the numerator are always listed first.

#### Degrees of Freedom in F-Distribution

The degrees of freedom for the F-distribution are associated with the numerator and denominator, indicated as F_{\nu_1, \nu_2}. For example, F_{3,16} represents the F-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom for the numerator and 16 degrees of freedom for the denominator.

#### Finding Values in the F-Distribution Table

The F-distribution table provides quantiles for various degrees of freedom choices. To find a specific value, such as the upper 5% point, look under $\alpha = 0.050$ and the corresponding degrees of freedom $\nu_1 = 3$ and $\nu_2 = 16$. For example, the value for the upper 5% point may be 3.24.

#### F-Statistic for Testing Equality of Variance

The null distribution of the test statistic $F=\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}$ is F$_{m-1,n-1}$. The degrees of freedom for the numerator is one less than the sample size used to compute $s_{1}^{2}$, and the degrees of freedom for the denominator is one less than the sample size used to compute $s_{2}^{2}$.

#### Example

In a series of experiments to determine the absorption rate of certain pesticides into skin, measured amounts of two pesticides were applied to several skin specimens. For pesticide A, the variance of the amounts absorbed in 6 specimens was 2.3, while for pesticide B, the variance of the amounts absorbed in 10 specimens was 0.6. Can we conclude that the variances of the two pesticides are equal?

#### Variance Comparison between Pesticide A and Pesticide B

Given:
- Population variance for pesticide A: $\sigma_1^2$
- Population variance for pesticide B: $\sigma_2^2$
- Null hypothesis: $H_0: \sigma_1^2 \leq \sigma_2^2$

Calculations:
- Sample variances: $s_1^2 = 2.3$ and $s_2^2 = 0.6$
- Test statistic: $F = \frac{2.3}{0.6} = 3.83$

Interpretation:
- Null distribution: $F_{5,9}$
- Larger F value indicates stronger evidence against $H_0$
- Comparing F value to critical values:
  - 5% critical value: 3.48
  - 1% critical value: 6.06

Conclusion:
- $0.01 < P < 0.05$
- Reasonably strong evidence against the null hypothesis

#### Principle of Testing H0: $\sigma_{1}^{2} / \sigma_{2}^{2} \geq 1$

- Test Statistic: $s_{2}^{2} / s_{1}^{2}$
- Distribution Under H0: $F_{n-1, m-1}$

#### Two-Tailed Hypothesis H0: $\sigma_{1}^{2} / \sigma_{2}^{2} = 1$

- Test Statistics: $s_{1}^{2} / s_{2}^{2}$ or $s_{2}^{2} / s_{1}^{2}$
- Evidence Against H0: Both large and small values of the statistic
- P-Value for Two-Tailed Test: Twice the P-value for the one-tailed test.

#### F-Distribution and Two-Tailed Test

Consider testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$. This is equivalent to $s_{21}/s_{22} = 1$. We use the test statistic $s_{21}/s_{22}$.

In the provided example, with a one-tailed test of $0.01 < P < 0.05$, for a two-tailed test, we have $0.02 < P < 0.10$.

#### Test for Equal Variances

The F-test for equal variances utilizes the test statistic with a normal distribution. In the example, the test statistic is 3.83, and the p-value is 0.078.

#### Sensitivity to Normality

Both the F-test and t-test assume normal populations. The F-test for variances is sensitive to departures from normality. If sample populations deviate significantly from normality, the F-test results may be misleading.

#### F-Distribution in Hypothesis Testing

 When performing hypothesis tests in linear regression and analysis of variance, the F-test is commonly used. It is less sensitive to violations of the normality assumption in these settings.

#### Caution with F-Test for Variances

It is important to note that the F-test cannot definitively prove that two variances are equal. Using the F-test to compare variances can be unreliable, as failure to reject the null hypothesis does not justify assuming equal variances.

#### 13. Inference on Sodium Content Variance

Referencing Exercise 11 in Section 5.6 to draw conclusions on the variance of sodium content.

#### Fixed-Level Testing

A hypothesis test evaluates the null hypothesis by generating a P-value. A smaller P-value indicates less support for the null hypothesis. There's no clear threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis based on the P-value alone. It's advisable to report the P-value and not rush to make a definitive decision. Circumstances may necessitate a decision, such as determining whether to recalibrate a process based on sampled data.

#### Fixed-Level Testing

The process of making a decision in hypothesis testing by setting a predetermined cutoff point, referred to as a fixed-level test.

$0 < \alpha < 1$: Significance level chosen for the test. If $P \leq \alpha$, reject null hypothesis; otherwise, consider null hypothesis plausible.

- **Decision Making**: 
  - $P \leq \alpha$: Reject null hypothesis, accept alternate hypothesis.
  - $P > \alpha$: Null hypothesis considered plausible.

- **Interpretation**:
  - Null hypothesis rejected at level $\alpha$ (or $100\alpha\%$) if $P \leq \alpha$.
  - Result is statistically significant at level $\alpha$ (or $100\alpha\%$).

#### Summary
- Choose a significance level, $\alpha$, where $0 < \alpha < 1$.
- Compute the P-value and compare it to $\alpha$.
- If $P \leq \alpha$, reject $H_0$. If $P > \alpha$, do not reject $H_0.

#### Example
Refer to Example 6.1 in Section 6.1 where a hypothesis test is conducted with the following data:
- Sample mean, $\bar{X} = 673.2 \mu m$
- Standard deviation, $s = 14.9 \mu m$
- Null hypothesis, $H_0: \mu \geq 675$; Alternative hypothesis, $H_1: \mu < 675$
- P-value obtained: $0.209$

#### Solution
- P-value of $0.209$ is less than $0.25$, so we reject $H_0$ at the 25% level.
- Since $0.209 > 0.05$, we do not reject $H_0$ at the 5% level.

In a fixed-level test, a critical point is a value of the test statistic that produces a P-value exactly equal to $\alpha$.

#### Hypothesis Testing

In hypothesis testing, the significance level is the dividing line for the P-value. 

If the test statistic is on one side of the critical point, the P-value will be less than $\alpha$, and $H_0$ will be rejected. 

If the test statistic is on the other side of the critical point, the P-value will be greater than $\alpha$, and $H_0$ will not be rejected. 

The region on the side of the critical point that leads to rejection is called the rejection region. 

The critical point itself is also in the rejection region. 

#### Example

A new concrete mix is being evaluated:

- Sample size: $n = 100$
- Sample mean: $X$
- Hypotheses: $H_0: \mu \leq 1350$ vs $H_1: \mu > 1350$
- Standard deviation: $\sigma \approx 70$

Find the critical point and the rejection region for a significance level of 5%. 

#### Solution

Reject $H_0$ if the P-value is less than or equal to 0.05.

#### P-Value Calculation

The P-value for a test is the area to the right of the value of $X$. It will be less than 0.05, and $H_0$ will be rejected if $X$ is in the upper 5% of the null distribution.

#### Rejection Region and Critical Point

The rejection region consists of the upper 5% of the null distribution. The critical point is the boundary of the upper 5%. The z-score that cuts off the upper 5% is $z_{0.05} = 1.645$, leading to the critical point as $z \geq 1.645$.

#### Expressing Critical Point in X

Converting the z-score to original units, the critical point in terms of $X$ is $X = 1350 + (1.645)(7) = 1361.5$. Thus, the rejection region includes all values of $X$ greater than or equal to 1361.5.

#### Rejection Region
The rejection region for a two-tailed test is contained in both tails of the null distribution. In this case, the rejection region consists of values of $X$ greater than or equal to $\mu + 1.96\sigma$ and values less than or equal to $\mu - 1.96\sigma$ at a significance level of 5%.

#### Example
In a hypothesis test with null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 1000$ and null distribution $X \sim N(1000, 0.262)$, the rejection region will be the upper and lower 2.5% of the distribution, corresponding to $X \geq 1000 + 1.96\sigma$ and $X \leq 1000 - 1.96\sigma$.

#### Critical Points and Rejection Region

The critical points for the two-tailed test are $999.49$ and $1000.51$. The rejection region for this test includes both the lower and upper $2.5\%$ of the null distribution.

#### Type I and Type II Errors

- Type I error occurs when $H_0$ is wrongly rejected (false positive).
- Type II error occurs when $H_0$ is not rejected when it is false (false negative).

When conducting experiments analyzed with a fixed-level test, it's crucial to minimize the probabilities of type I and type II errors to ensure the validity of the results.

#### Type I Error Probability Control

Given a significance level $\alpha$ for a test, the probability of a type I error is never greater than $\alpha$.

#### Example Illustration

- Scenario: Large random sample $X_1, ..., X_n$ from a population with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.
- Distribution: $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$.
- Hypothesis: $H_0: \mu \leq 0$ vs. $H_1: \mu > 0$ at $\alpha = 0.05$.
- Rejection: Reject $H_0$ if $P \leq 0.05$.
- Null Distribution: $N(0, \sigma^2 X)$.

We calculate the probability of a type I error and verify it is no greater than 0.05.

#### Basic Concepts of Type I Error

$H_0$: null hypothesis  
$P \leq 0.05$: rejection of $H_0$  
$X \geq 1.645\sigma_X$: rejection region  
$\mu \leq 0$: true mean parameter  

#### Probability of Type I Error

If $H_0$ is true, $μ≤0$ and $μ=0$:

- When $μ=0$, $P(X\geq1.645\sigma_X) = 0.05$
- For $μ<0$, $P(X\geq1.645\sigma_X)<0.05$, leading to a type I error probability < 0.05
- Probability of type I error NEVER greater than α if $H_0$ is true
- Probability of type I error is equal to α when $μ$ is at the boundary of $H_0$ ($μ=0$ in this case)

#### Controlling Type I Error

- Probability of type I error can be made as small as desired, never exceeding the significance level $\alpha$.

#### Significance Level $\alpha$

- The significance level $\alpha$ is the probability of committing a type I error. 
- It is typically chosen at the beginning of a hypothesis test to control the likelihood of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.
- A common choice for $\alpha$ is 0.05.

#### Type I and Type II Errors

- **Type I Error**: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This is controlled by setting the significance level $\alpha$.
- **Type II Error**: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.
- The probability of a type II error increases as the probability of type I error decreases.
- Controlling the size of the type II error is more challenging than controlling the type I error.

#### Hypothesis Testing with P-Value

- Consider a hypothesis test where the P-value is $0.03$.
    - H0 is rejected at the $5\%$ level. (True)
    - H0 is rejected at the $2\%$ level. (False)
    - H0 is not rejected at the $10\%$ level. (False)

#### Ore Impurity Testing

- For a process aiming to reduce impurity to less than $2\%$, with a known standard deviation of $0.6\%$:
    - The hypothesis test performed is $H0: \mu \geq 2$ vs. $H1: \mu < 2$.
        a. For a test conducted at the $5\%$ level, the rejection region is when the sample mean impurity is less than $1.96$.
        b. If the sample mean impurity level is $1.85$, H0 will be rejected at the $10\%$ level.
        c. If the sample mean is $1.85$, H0 will be rejected at the $1\%$ level.
        d. If the critical point is $1.9$, the level of the test corresponds to the significance level associated with the critical point.

#### a. Null and Alternate Hypotheses
- $H_0: \mu \geq 90$ (Stopping distance of new braking system is greater than or equal to 90 ft)
- $H_1: \mu < 90$ (Stopping distance of new braking system is less than 90 ft)

#### b. Rejection Region at 5% Level
- Rejection region: $X̄ < \mu_0 - \frac{Z_{\alpha}\cdot\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
- Rejection region: $X̄ < 90 - \frac{1.645 \cdot 5}{\sqrt{150}}$
- Rejection region: $X̄ < 89.117$ ft

#### c. Rejection Region Discussion
- Rejecting $H_0$ if $X̄ \geq 89.4$ ft is not appropriate as the rejection region should be set based on the significance level of the test.

#### d. Another Rejection Region Discussion
- Rejecting $H_0$ if $X̄ \leq 89.4$ ft is also not appropriate. The rejection region should be set based on the significance level of the test, not on arbitrary fixed points.

#### 1. Test of Hypotheses

Someone suggests rejecting \( H_0 \) if \( X \leq 89.4 \) or \( X \geq 90.6 \) ft. Is this an appropriate rejection region, or is something wrong? If this is an appropriate rejection region, find the level of the test.

#### 2. Type I and Type II Errors

A test is made of the hypotheses \( H_0: \mu \leq 10 \) versus \( H_1: \mu > 10 \). For each of the following situations, determine whether the decision was correct, a type I error occurred, or a type II error occurred.

- \( \mu = 8 \), \( H_0 \) is rejected.
- \( \mu = 10 \), \( H_0 \) is not rejected.
- \( \mu = 14 \), \( H_0 \) is not rejected.
- \( \mu = 12 \), \( H_0 \) is rejected.

#### 3. Proportion Test

A vendor claims that no more than 10% of the parts she supplies are defective. Let \( p \) denote the actual proportion of parts that are defective. A test is made of the hypotheses \( H_0: p \leq 0.10 \) versus \( H_1: p > 0.10 \). For each of the following situations, determine whether the decision was correct, a type I error occurred, or a type II error occurred.

- The claim is true, and \( H_0 \) is rejected.
- The claim is false, and \( H_0 \) is rejected.

#### Important Concepts from the Provided Text

1. **Claim is False, and H0 is Not Rejected:** This scenario occurs in hypothesis testing when the null hypothesis (H0) is not rejected despite the claim being false.

2. **Maximum Probability of Rejecting H0:** When performing a hypothesis test and deciding to reject H0 if P ≤ 0.10, the maximum probability that H0 will be rejected when it is true is 0.10.

3. **Error in Testing Process:** In the context of testing a new process for the liquefaction of coal, the decision to put the new process into production is based on whether H0: μ ≤ 15 is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1: μ > 15. To minimize the costly error of putting the new process into production if it is not better than the old process, choosing to test at the 1% level provides a smaller probability for this error compared to testing at the 5% level.

4. **Power of a Hypothesis Test:** The concept of power in hypothesis testing measures the ability of a test to correctly reject the null hypothesis when it is false. It is an important aspect to consider in the evaluation of the effectiveness of a hypothesis test.

#### Type II Error and Power of a Test
A type II error occurs when $H_0$ is not rejected when it is false. The power of a test is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when it is false. Therefore, Power = $1 - P(\text{type II error})$.

To be useful, a test must have reasonably small probabilities of both type I and type II errors. Choosing a small value of $\alpha$ for the significance level helps keep the type I error small. Calculating the power of the test is important. A useful test will have a large power, leading to a small probability of type II error. Power calculations are generally done before data collection to assess the likelihood of rejecting $H_0$ if it is false.

For example, in a power calculation for a new chemical process that may increase yield over the current process with a known mean yield of 80 and a standard deviation of 5 (in percentage units), understanding the power of the test is crucial for decision-making.

#### Hypothesis Testing
In a hypothesis test, we compare a null hypothesis $H_{0}$ with an alternative hypothesis $H_{1}$.

#### Significance Level
The significance level, denoted by $\alpha$, is the probability of rejecting $H_{0}$ when it is true. It is usually set at 0.05 or 5%.

#### Power of the Test
The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_{0}$ when $H_{1}$ is true. It depends on the true parameter value assumed under $H_{1}$.

#### Computation of Power
To compute the power of the test, a specific value for the parameter under $H_{1}$ needs to be specified. In this case, assuming $μ=81$.

#### Relationship between Power and Parameter
The power of a test varies with the distance between the hypothesized value under $H_{0}$ and the true value under $H_{1}$. Closer values result in lower power.

#### Power Calculation Steps

1. **Compute rejection region:**
    - Find the null distribution: $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma_X)$
    - Calculate standard deviation $\sigma_X$: $\sigma_X = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
    
2. **Compute power:**
    - Find the probability test statistic falls in rejection region if alternate hypothesis is true

#### Approximating Standard Deviation σ

- Estimating $\sigma$ when sample has not been drawn:
    - Consider preliminary sample standard deviation
    - Use other methods for approximation

#### Population Standard Deviation Estimation
Given a population standard deviation $\sigma = 5$, we estimate the standard deviation of a sample from a similar population as $\sigma_X = \frac{5}{\sqrt{50}} = 0.707$.

#### Null Distribution and Hypothesis Testing
Under the assumption that $\mu \leq 80$, large values of $X$ disagree with $H_0$. The P-value is the area to the right of the observed value of $X$. If $X$ falls into the upper 5% of the null distribution, the P-value will be less than or equal to 0.05. The rejection region is the upper 5% of the null distribution.

#### Rejection Region
The critical point has a z-score of 1.645, resulting in a value of $81.16$ when added to the mean. Thus, we reject $H_0$ if $X \geq 81.16$, which defines the rejection region.

#### Region

The rejection region for a hypothesis test is where the P-value is less than the significance level (usually 0.05).

The power of a test is the probability that a random variable falls into the rejection region when the alternate hypothesis is true.

Under the alternate hypothesis $\mu=81$, if the distribution of $X$ is normal with mean 81 and standard deviation 0.707, the power is calculated as 0.4090.

#### Alternate Distribution
$H_1 \text{ shifts the null distribution so that the mean becomes the alternate mean of 81 rather than the null mean of 80.}$

#### Rejection Region Probability
$The probability that the test statistic falls into the rejection region is greater under $H_1$ than under $H_0$.$

#### Power of the Test
$The z-score under $H_1$ for the critical point 81.16 is z = \frac{(81.16 - 81)}{0.707} = 0.23.$ The area to the right of $z = 0.23$ is 0.4090. This is the power of the test.$

#### Interpreting Power
$A power of 0.4090 is low, meaning there is only a 41% chance that the experiment will detect the improvement. Investing time and money is unwise due to the high chance of failure.$ 

#### Test Worthiness
$The power of a test determines its worthiness. If the power is not sufficiently high, running the experiment may not be worthwhile.$

#### Power of a Statistical Test

The power of a statistical test is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. It is the ability of the test to detect a true effect if it exists.

#### Factors Affecting Power

1. Significance Level: The higher the significance level ($\alpha$), the greater the chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.

2. Sample Size: Increasing the sample size generally leads to higher power as it reduces sampling variability.

3. Effect Size: Power increases as the effect size (difference between null and alternate hypothesis values) increases.

4. Variability: Greater variability in the data reduces power as it makes it harder to detect true effects.

#### Determining Power

Power calculations depend on factors such as the desired significance level, effect size, sample size, and variability. A power greater than 0.80 or 0.90 is typically considered acceptable.

#### Example 6.30

Given a test of $H_0: \mu \le 80$ vs $H_1: \mu > 80$ with $\mu = 82$, $n = 50$, and $\sigma = 5$, the power is calculated by finding the area under the alternate distribution curve beyond the critical point. Here, the power is 0.8830.

#### Power

$z_0=1.645$, $z_1=-1.19$

The power ($0.8830$) is the area of the rejection region under the alternate distribution. Power depends on the chosen alternate value for $\mu$. It can range from slightly greater than the significance level $\alpha$ up to $1$. 

- Power is low when the alternate mean is close to the null mean, and high when the alternate mean is far from the null.
- Increasing the sample size can increase the power when it is not large enough.

#### Experiment Sample Size Calculation

In determining the sample size for an experiment to achieve a desired power, one can follow these key steps:

1. **Define Hypotheses**: Clearly state the null and alternative hypotheses, such as $H_0: \mu \leq 80$ and $H_1: \mu > 80$.
   
2. **Calculate Necessary Sample Size (n)**: 
   
   - Null Distribution: The critical point is determined as $\mu_0 + Z_{\alpha}( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} )$, where $\mu_0$ is the mean under the null hypothesis, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, and $Z_{\alpha}$ is the corresponding z-score for the significance level.
   
   - Alternate Distribution: The critical point here can be found based on the desired power of the test, which could require calculating z-scores under the alternate hypothesis.
   
3. **Solve the Problem**: With the given information, you can find the necessary sample size using the null and alternate distributions to achieve the specified power level.

#### Critical Point Calculation

- The critical point is calculated as $81 - 1.28 \cdot \frac{5}{\sqrt{n}}$

#### Setting Up Equality

- $80 + 1.645 \cdot 5 \sqrt{n} = 81 - 1.28 \cdot 5 \sqrt{n}$

#### Solving for Sample Size

- By setting the two expressions equal, we solve for $n \approx 214$

#### Critical Point Value

- Critical point value when $n = 214$ is $80.56$

#### Power Calculation

- To achieve a power of 0.90, the critical points are $z_0 = 1.645$ and $z_1 = -1.28$

#### Concepts:
- Large-sample test of a population mean can be extended to compute power and needed sample sizes for two-tailed tests and tests for proportions
- Computing power for t-tests, F-tests, or chi-square tests is more challenging
- Computer packages can compute power and needed sample sizes for various statistical tests

#### Example:
- A pollster conducting a survey to estimate the proportion of voters who support a measure on school bonds
- Testing $H_0: p = 0.50$ versus $H_1: p \neq 0.50$ at the 5% level
- Power of the test with a true value of $p = 0.55$ when 200 voters are sampled
- Computer output from MINITAB shows the solution for power and sample size

#### Power Calculation for Single Population Proportion Test

$ p = 0.55 $

$ n = 200 $

$ \text{Power} = 0.292 $

#### Example - Calculating Sample Size for Desired Power

Given $ p = 0.55 $ and desired power of $ 0.8 $:

$ n = 783 $

#### Minimum Sample Size Calculation with Power Analysis

The actual power being slightly higher than 0.80 signifies that MINITAB calculates the smallest sample size for which the power exceeds the target power of 0.80.

#### Example Scenario

Shipments of coffee beans are inspected for moisture content to detect possible water contamination. Five random moisture measurements are taken to test if the mean moisture content exceeds 10% with a significance level of 5%, using the Student's t-test.

#### Power Calculation

Given a true moisture content of 12% and a standard deviation of $σ=1.5%$, the power of the test is calculated to determine the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

#### Power Calculation Example

Given: 
- Mean = null + difference
- Alpha = 0.05
- Assumed standard deviation = 1.5

For a sample with a difference size of 2, the power is 0.786. Power is dependent on the difference between true mean and null mean.

#### Sample Size for Power of 0.9

To achieve a power of at least 0.9:
- Testing mean = null (versus > null)
- Difference size of 2
- Sample size needed is 7, with an actual power of 0.926750.




#### Power Calculations in Scientific Research

Power calculations are crucial in scientific research as they determine the ability to detect significant effects when hypothesis tests are performed in a study. 

#### Exercise 1

#### Concepts:

1. If the level $α$ increases, then the power will _increase_.
2. If the level $α$ remains the same, and the sample size increases, then the power will _increase_.

#### Tire Company Example:

c. **Rejection Values for Desired Power**:
   - To achieve a power of 0.95 with a true mean content of 965 ppm, the values of $X$ that lead to rejection of $H_0$ need to be determined.

d. **Rejection Values for 5% Level Test**:
   - For a test with a level of 5%, the values of $X$ at which $H_0$ should be rejected need to be identified.

   - Determine the required sample size to achieve a power of 0.95 for a 5% level test with a true mean content of 965 ppm.

#### Power Calculation for Test of $\mu=8$ vs. $\mu<10$

Given power of the test when $\mu=8$ is 0.90 for testing $H_0: \mu \geq 10$ vs. $H_1: \mu < 10$, we need to determine the power when $\mu=7$.

- The power of the test will be less than 0.90.

#### Testing Proportion of Defectives

For a new process aiming to reduce defectives to 10% with true $p=0.06:

a. Level of the test: Reject $H_0$ if $X\leq 18$

b. Power of the test: Find the power of the test to detect $p=0.06$ when $H_0$ is rejected if $X\leq 18$.

c. Same standard deviation: Yes, use the same standard deviation to compute both the power and the level of the test.

#### Sampling for Power Analysis

Given a test at the 5% level, to achieve a power of 0.90, the formula for the sample size ($n$) required is:

$$ n = \left(\frac{z_{\alpha} + z_{\beta}}{p_1 - p_2}\right)^2 $$

Where $z_{\alpha}$ and $z_{\beta}$ are the corresponding z-values for the significance level and power level, and $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the proportions under the null and alternative hypothesis, respectively.

#### Power Calculation Insights

a. The power is typically calculated for a one-tailed test or a specific direction of the alternative hypothesis.

b. The null hypothesis for which the power is calculated typically assumes that there is no effect or difference, often represented as $H_0: p = p_0$.

c. The power is calculated for a specific alternative value of the population proportion, denoted as $p_1$.

d. With a sample size of 100, it is impossible to determine if the power would be less than 0.7, greater than 0.7, or equal to 0.7 without additional information.

e. With a sample size of 200, it is impossible to determine if the power would be less than 0.6, greater than 0.6, or equal to 0.6 without additional information.

f. The power against the alternative $p=$ needs to be completed in the given context.

#### Power Calculation Interpretation
- $0.3 < 0.65 < 0.45$: The power is between 0.3 and 0.65.
- For a sample size of 150, it is impossible to determine if the power is less than 0.65, greater than 0.65, or equal to 0.65 without additional information.

#### MINITAB Power Calculation
- The power calculation in MINITAB output is for a one-tailed test.
- The power is calculated for an alternate value of $\mu = 3 + \text{difference}$.
- If the sample size were 25, it is impossible to determine if the power would be less than 0.85, greater than 0.85, or equal to 0.85 without additional information.
- If the difference were 0.5, it is impossible to determine if the power would be less than 0.90, greater than 0.90, or equal to 0.90 without additional information.

#### Power Calculation in Statistics

- Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
- It depends on sample size, effect size, alpha level, and variability in the data.
- Calculating power involves determining the likelihood of detecting an effect if it truly exists.

#### Interpretation of Power Output

- Power close to 1 (e.g., > 0.85) indicates a high chance of detecting an effect if present.
- Power close to 0 (e.g., < 0.85) suggests a low probability of correctly detecting an effect.

#### Analysis of Power Calculation Results

- For the given output, the power is calculated for a two-tailed test.
- With a sample size of 50 in each group, the power might be greater than 0.9 due to the increased sample size.
- If the difference in means were 4 instead of 3, the power could potentially increase beyond 0.9 as effect size impacts power.

#### Multiple Tests

When performing multiple hypothesis tests, it is important to note that with an increasing number of tests, the confidence in the results decreases. 

In an example where 20 different formulations are tested for reducing wear on cam gears, each formulation is tested for the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu \geq 10$. This scenario illustrates the diminishing confidence as more tests are conducted.

#### Hypothesis Testing for Wear Reduction
- **Scenario**: Testing wear reduction formulations.
- **Hypothesis**: $H_0$: Formulation does not reduce wear.
- **Results**: 19 out of 20 formulations did not reject $H_0$. One formulation rejected $H_0.
- **Conclusion**: Premature to assume wear reduction based on one rejected result.
  
#### Type I Error Probability Calculation
- **Assumption**: Formulation has no effect on wear (μ=100μm).
- **Type I Error**: Rejecting $H_0$ when it's true.
- **Calculation**: Probability of a type I error is 5% (significance level).
- **Result**: Probability of a type I error = 0.05.
  
#### Importance of Multiple Tests
- **Example**: Testing multiple formulations is crucial to avoid premature conclusions.
- **Consideration**: Probability of making a wrong conclusion decreases with more tests.


#### Formulation Effect on Wear

It is plausible that none of the formulations have any effect on wear. With 20 hypothesis tests conducted, each with a 5% chance of a type I error, it is expected that on average, one true null hypothesis out of every 20 will be rejected. Therefore, rejecting H0 in one out of 20 tests is expected if none of the formulations made a difference.

$H_0$: No effect on wear

#### Probability of Rejecting H0

If none of the 20 formulations have any effect on wear, the probability of not rejecting H0 for all formulations is $0.95$.

#### Multiple Testing Problem

The probability that $H_0$ is not rejected for any of the 20 formulations is $0.95^{20} = 0.36$. Therefore, the probability that we incorrectly reject $H_0$ for one or more of the formulations is $1 - 0.36 = 0.64.

#### Experiment Scenario

If the experiment is repeated without applying the coatings, there is a high likelihood that one or more of the formulations will appear to reduce wear, leading to the rejection of $H_0$.

#### Conclusion

Examples 6.36 through 6.39 demonstrate the multiple testing problem, where the more tests conducted increase the chances of wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis due to strong evidence not guaranteeing certainty.

#### Bonferroni Method

The Bonferroni method adjusts P-values upward when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted. The adjustment involves multiplying the P-value by the number of tests performed.

#### Example

Four coating formulations are tested for wear reduction on cam gears. null hypothesis, $H_0: \mu \geq 100 \mu m$, is tested for each formulation:

- Formulation A: $P=0.37$
- Formulation B: $P=0.41$
- Formulation C: $P=0.005$
- Formulation D: $P=0.21$

The operator suspects formulation C may be effective, but notes the P-value of 0.005 is unreliable when multiple tests are conducted.

#### Bonferroni Adjustment for Multiple Testing

The Bonferroni adjustment formula for P-value is $P = m \cdot \alpha$, where $m$ is the number of tests performed and $\alpha$ is the significance level.

#### Bonferroni Adjustment Example

Given an initial P-value of 0.03 for formulation C and $m = 4$ tests, the adjusted P-value is $P = 4 \cdot 0.03 = 0.12$.

#### Bonferroni Adjustment and Conclusion

The Bonferroni adjustment is conservative and never produces a smaller P-value. When the adjusted P-value is small, the null hypothesis can be rejected decisively.

#### Bonferroni Adjustment
$P_{\text{adjusted}} > P_{\text{original}}$  
- Original P-value is small, but Bonferroni adjustment prevents rejecting null hypothesis.

#### Retesting Hypotheses
$P_{\text{adjusted}} > \text{Threshold}$, $P_{\text{original}} < \text{Threshold}$  
- Retest hypothesis with new data to confirm suspicion against null hypothesis.

#### Monitoring Industrial Processes
Determining if process is malfunctioning or type I error:  
- Regular sampling and testing process output for specification adherence.
- Multiple testing problem may arise, requiring careful evaluation.

#### Multiple Testing Problem in Statistical Quality Control

$ The subject of statistical quality control is dedicated to finding ways to overcome the multiple testing problem. $

#### Exercise 1

$ An agricultural scientist tests six types of fertilizer to determine if any produces an increase in yield of lima beans. Fertilizer C shows a statistically significant increase, but the conclusion that its yield is greater than the current fertilizer is not justified. $

#### Exercise 2

$ Using the Bonferroni correction, a reliable P-value for fertilizer C can be produced. With a P-value of 0.03, reject $H_0$ if the corrected P-value is less than the significance level $α$. $

#### Exercise 3

$ Six different settings are tried on a machine to see if... $

#### Bonferroni-Adjusted P-Values

a. **For the setting with P-value 0.002:**

The Bonferroni-adjusted P-value is calculated as $\frac{0.05}{6} = 0.0083$.

This setting significantly reduces the proportion of defective parts because its adjusted P-value is less than the significance level (0.05).

b. **For the setting with P-value 0.03:**

The Bonferroni-adjusted P-value is calculated as $\frac{0.05}{6} = 0.0083$.

This setting may not conclusively reduce the proportion of defective parts as its adjusted P-value is not lower than the significance level.

#### Next Steps for Bolt-Making Process

The best choice is:

i. **Implement the process with P-value 0.03:**

This process showed a statistically significant improvement in the mean breaking strength and has the lowest P-value among the options given.

#### 4. Process Reruns
i. If the P-value is less than 0.05, stick with the current process.
ii. Rerun the process with a P-value of 0.03 to check if it remains significant without multiple testing.
iii. Rerun all variations to see if any produce a small P-value again.

#### 5. Bonferroni Adjustment
For a Bonferroni-adjusted P-value of 0.05, the original P-value must be $0.05/20 = 0.0025$.

#### 6. Paint Additives Trial
Testing five new paint additives:
- Additive A: Mean drying time 14.573, 12.012, 13.449, 13.928, 13.123, 13.254, 12.772
- Additive B: Mean drying time 10.393, 10.435, 11.440, 9.719, 11.045, 11.707, 11.141
- Additive C: Mean drying time 15.497, 9.162, 11.394, 10.766, 11.025, 10.636, 15
- Additive D: Mean drying time 10.350, 7.324, 10.338, 11.600, 10.725, 12.240
- Additive E: Mean drying time 11.263, 10.848, 11.499, 10.493, 13.409, 10.219

#### Additive Hypothesis Testing

For each additive, perform a hypothesis test with the following hypotheses:

$H_0: \mu \geq 12$  
$H_1: \mu < 12$

a. **P-values:**  
Additive 1: $p = 0.0062$  
Additive 2: $p = 0.0401$  
Additive 3: $p = 0.0341$  
Additive 4: $p = 0.1337$  
Additive 5: $p = 0.9986$

b. **Conclusions:**  
Based on the results:  
i. At least one of the new additives results in an improvement.  
ii. None of the new additives result in an improvement.  
iii. Some of the new additives may result in improvement, but the evidence is inconclusive.

#### Fuse Amperage Hypothesis Testing

Performing a hypothesis test for fuses rated at 15 A:

$H_0: \mu = 15$  
$H_1: \mu \neq 15$

a. On 10 of the 200 days, $H_0$ is rejected at the 5% level.

#### 6.15 Using Simulation to Perform Hypothesis Tests

If $X_1, ..., X_n$ are normally distributed random variables with known standard deviations $\sigma_1, ..., \sigma_n$, and $U = U(X_1, ..., X_n)$ is a function of $X_1, ..., X_n$, then $U$ is often approximately normally distributed and its standard deviation $\sigma_U$ can be estimated. This allows us to perform hypothesis tests on the mean $\mu_U$ of $U.

To determine if $U$ is approximately normally distributed and estimate $\sigma_U$, simulation can be used, similar to the method in Section 5.10.

**Question (a):** Would there be conclusive evidence that the mean burnout amperage was different from 15 A on at least one of the 200 days?

**Question (b):** Would the answer to part (a) be different if $H_0$ had been rejected on 20 of the 200 days?

#### Measurement of Volume of Cylinder

Given: $V = \pi R^2 H$, $R = 4.8$ cm, $H = 10.1$ cm, $\sigma_R = 0.1$ cm, $\sigma_H = 0.2$ cm, $V = 731.06$ cm$^3$

1. **Hypotheses Testing**
   - Test of hypotheses: $H_0 : \mu_V \leq 700$ vs $H_1 : \mu_V > 700$
   
2. **Assumption**
   - If $V$ is normally distributed with known population standard deviation $\sigma_V$, under $H_0$: $V \sim N(700, \sigma_V^2)$

3. **Conclusion**
   - Given the test statistic falls beyond a certain critical value, we can conclude whether the true volume is greater than 700 cm$^3$

#### P-value Calculation for Normal Distribution

Given $H_0: \mu_V \leq 700$ and computing $P(V \geq 731.06)$ under $V \sim N(700, \sigma_V^2)$, the z-score is $(731.06 - 700) / \sigma_V$. If $\sigma_V$ were known, we could calculate the z-score and use the z-table to find the P-value.

#### Determining Normality and Approximating Parameters

To check if $V$ is normally distributed and approximate $\sigma_V$, generate $N$ values $R^*_1, ..., R^*_N$ for radius measurement, known to be $N(4.8, 0.1)$. Generate $R^*_1, ..., R^*_N$ from $N(4.8, 0.12)$ and $H^*_1, ..., H^*_N$ from $N(10.1, 0.22)$. Compute simulated volume measurements $V^*_i = \pi(R^*_i)^2H^*_i$. Use a normal probability plot of $V^*$ to assess normality.

#### Figure 6.31 for Normality Assessment

Refer to Figure 6.31 on page 498 for a normal probability plot of a sample.

#### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals 

Given a level $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence interval for a parameter, such as a population mean $\mu$, we can reject at level $100\alpha \%$ the null hypothesis that the parameter is equal to any given value outside the interval, and cannot reject at level $100\alpha \%$ the null hypothesis that the parameter is equal to any given value inside the interval.

#### Normality Assumption Verification

The normality assumption for the sample data is justified by examining the normal probability plot for 1000 simulated volumes.

#### Fixed-Level Hypothesis Test

A fixed-level hypothesis test involves testing a hypothesis at a specific significance level, such as 5%. An example of a hypothesis test is provided below.

Example:
Given a 95% confidence interval for the mean mileage of trucks as (4.7643, 6.4757) mpg, we test whether the population mean mileage differs from 5 mpg or 7 mpg at the 5% significance level.

Solution:
The 95% confidence interval contains values that are not rejected at the 5% level. Therefore, we conclude that the population mean differs from 7 mpg, but not from 5 mpg at the 5% significance level.

#### Randomization Tests

Randomization tests, also known as permutation tests, are methods used to test differences between two population means without making distribution assumptions. Although computationally intensive, these tests have become feasible with advances in technology.

Example:
A crop scientist is conducting a randomization test to compare yield densities between two different fertilizer treatments.

#### Hypothesis Testing for Yield Increase Experiment

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in yield between the two fertilizers.
$$H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B$$

The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in yield between the two fertilizers.
$$H_1: \mu_A \neq \mu_B$$

To test this hypothesis, a suitable statistical test such as a two-sample t-test can be conducted to determine if the difference in means is statistically significant.

The test statistic can be calculated using the formula:
$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B}{\sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}}}$$

Where:
- \( \bar{x}_A \) and \( \bar{x}_B \) are the sample means for fertilizers A and B.
- \( s_A \) and \( s_B \) are the sample standard deviations for fertilizers A and B.
- \( n_A \) and \( n_B \) are the sample sizes for fertilizers A and B.

Based on the calculated t-statistic, a decision can be made to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, depending on the chosen significance level (typically 0.05).

If the null hypothesis is rejected, it can be concluded that there is a significant difference in yield between the two fertilizers, indicating that the choice of fertilizer may impact lettuce yield.

#### Hypotheses  
- $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$  
- $H_1: \mu_1 < \mu_2$  

#### Test Statistic  
- $T = B - A$  
- Observed value: $10.0$

#### P-Value  
- Larger test statistic value implies stronger evidence against $H_0$  
- P-value measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis

#### Calculation of P-Value  
- Number of ways to select $k$ items from $n$ items: $\binom{n}{k}$  

#### Binomial Coefficient Formula
The number of ways to choose k items from n items is given by the formula:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

#### Calculating Number of Choices
For choosing 10 plots from 20, we have:

$$
\binom{20}{10} = 184,756
$$

#### P-Value Calculation
The P-value is the probability that the test statistic (B - A) is greater than or equal to 10 under the null hypothesis. It can be calculated as the proportion of possible outcomes where (B - A) is greater than or equal to 10.

#### Randomization Test for Determining Proportion of Outcomes
We have outcomes for $B-A \geq 10$ by conducting a randomization test or permutation test. To compute the exact P-value, we can work with a randomly generated collection of outcomes.

#### Subset Selection and Test Statistic Calculation
- Subsets of 10 yields are assigned to treatment A.
- Each subset corresponds to an outcome, and the test statistic is computed for each subset.

#### P-Value Estimation
- P-value is approximated by the proportion of randomly chosen outcomes where the test statistic is greater than or equal to the observed value of 10.

#### Analysis of Outcomes
- Initially, 5 outcomes were considered, and none had B-A values greater than or equal to 10, resulting in a P-value estimate of 0.
- With the full set of 1000 outcomes, only 9 had B-A values greater than or equal to 10.
- The estimated P-value is 0.009, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis implying a difference between fertilizers.

#### Student’s t-test for the Difference Between Means
The Student's t-test provides a good approximation to the randomization test for comparing means when no outliers are present.

#### Randomization Tests for Two Sample Populations
Randomization tests can be an alternative to the t-test when outliers are present and can be used for comparing means from two populations.

#### Rank Tests for Randomized Experiments
Rank tests are sometimes used in randomized experiments in addition to the t-test.

#### Simulation for Hypothesis Tests

$B - A = -2.40$

$B - A = 4.60$

$B - A = 2.00$

$B - A = -4.80$

$B - A = 0.20$

$B - A = -3.20$

#### Simulation for Estimating Power

In some cases, it is challenging to calculate power accurately.

#### Simulation for Power Estimation

Simulation can be used to estimate the power of a statistical test.

#### Example

A new type of weld is being developed. If the mean fracture toughness of this weld is conclusively shown to be greater than $20 \, ft \cdot lb$, the weld will be used in a certain application. Assume toughness is normally distributed with standard deviation equal to $4 \, ft \cdot lb$. Six welds will be made, and the fracture toughness of each will be measured.

A Student’s t-test will be made of the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu \leq 20$ versus $H_1: \mu > 20$. If the test is conducted at a significance level of 5%, what is the power of the test if the true mean toughness is $25 \, ft \cdot lb$?

#### Solution

Let $X_1, ..., X_6$ represent the six sample toughnesses, and let $s$ represent their sample standard deviation. This is a sample from a $N(25, 16)$ distribution. The test statistic is $T = \frac{X - 20}{s / \sqrt{6}}$. Under $H_0$, this statistic has a Student’s $t$-distribution with 5 degrees of freedom. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the value...

#### Test Statistic Calculation
The test statistic is calculated as:
$T^* = \dfrac{X_i^* - 20}{s_i^*/\sqrt{6}}$

#### Power Calculation
The power is determined as:
$P(T^* > 2.015)$

#### Simulation Experiment
- Generate 10,000 samples $X_i^*$
- Each sample is from a $N(25, 16)$ distribution
- Compute sample mean $X_i^*$ and sample standard deviation $s_i^*$
- Calculate test statistic $T^* = \dfrac{X_i^* - 20}{s_i^*/\sqrt{6}}$

#### Estimating Probability
Since the null hypothesis is false, the probability calculation is done through a simulation experiment.

#### Hypothesis Testing with Simulated Samples

Given a set of $10,000$ simulated samples, each statistically equivalent to a sample of actual welds, the power of the test can be estimated by computing the proportion of simulated samples in which the null hypothesis is rejected (i.e., the test statistic exceeds $2.015$). 

- For the first 10 samples, the null hypothesis is rejected for 9 out of 10 samples.
- The last sample also follows this trend, with a value of the test statistic exceeding $2.015$.

This suggests that the simulated samples are drawn from the same distribution as the actual toughnesses of the welds.

#### Power Estimation Example

If we base our results on the first 10 samples, we estimate the power to be $0.9$. However, out of 10,000 samples, the null hypothesis was rejected for 8366 of them, giving an estimated power of $0.8366$.

#### Rejection of Null Hypotheses

1. **Null Hypotheses Testing**
   - For the following null hypotheses:
      i. $H_0: \mu = 38.53$
      ii. $H_0: \mu = 38.35$
      iii. $H_0: \mu = 38.45$
      iv. $H_0: \mu = 38.55$
   - a. Rejected at 5% level: N/A
   - b. Rejected at 10% level: N/A

2. **Bootstrap Samples**
   - Let $\mu$ represent the population mean compressive strength, in MPa.
   - Generate 1000 bootstrap samples.

#### Bootstrap Method for Hypothesis Testing

$2.1$ to $3.0$ $\Rightarrow$ Reject at $5\%$ level 

$3.4$ to $4.0$ $\Rightarrow$ Reject at $10\%$ level 

#### Bootstrap Experiment

Results may not necessarily agree if performed twice on the same data.

#### Lettuce Yield Example

Not a good idea to use t-test to determine fertilizer effects on yield; consider using other methods.

#### Premium Gasoline Experiment

Comparative study on mileage using premium vs. regular gasoline for cars with a specific engine design.

#### a. 
Under the null hypothesis that each car would get the same mileage with either type of gasoline, there are $2^8 = 256$ possible outcomes for this experiment.

#### b. 
Let $R$ and $P$ denote the sample mean mileages for the regular and premium groups, respectively. Compute $R$ and $P$.

#### c. 
Perform a randomization test to determine whether it can be concluded that premium gasoline tends to increase mileage. Use the test statistic $P - R$. Generate at least 1000 random outcomes, and estimate the p-value.

#### d. 
Use the Student’s t-test to test the null hypothesis that the mean mileage using regular is greater than or equal to the mean mileage for premium. Is this result reliable? Explain.

#### 5. 
For the lettuce yield data, it is thought that the yields from fertilizer A might have a larger variance than the yields from fertilizer B.

### Note: 
In all statistical tests, it is important to appropriately interpret the results considering the context of the experiment and the assumptions of the statistical test being used.

#### F-Test for Variance Comparison
- Given two sets of data $A$ and $B$, with variances $s^{2}_A$ and $s^{2}_B$ respectively, the F-test helps in comparing their variances using the ratio of variances $s^{2}_A/s^{2}_B$.

#### Randomization Test
- To test the hypothesis $H_0: s^{2}_A \leq s^{2}_B$ versus $H_1: s^{2}_A > s^{2}_B$, you can perform a randomization test using the test statistic $s^{2}_A/s^{2}_B$ with a minimum of 1000 random outcomes.

#### Randomization Test for Variance Comparison
- Conduct a randomization test to determine if the mileage using regular gasoline has a greater variance than the mileage using premium gasoline by generating at least 1000 random outcomes.

#### Hypothesis Testing for pH Measurements
- In the context of wastewater treatment, a hypothesis test can be conducted to compare the mean pH of treated wastewater to a neutral value of 7. Measurements will be made on seven specimens, with hypotheses $H_0: \mu = 7$ versus $H_1: \mu \neq 7$.

#### Student’s t-test

Given:
- True mean, $μ = 6.5$
- pH measurements normally distributed with mean $μ$ and standard deviation $0.5$
- Test conducted at the $5\%$ level

a. Test statistic:
- Test statistic = $\dfrac{\overline{X} - μ}{s/\sqrt{n}}$
- Reject $H_0$ for test statistic values beyond critical value

b. Power of the test:
- Generate 10,000 samples from true distribution
- Calculate test statistic for each sample and determine if $H_0$ is rejected
- Estimate power of the test

#### Paired t-test vs. Two-sample t-test

- In a two-sample experiment with paired data, use paired t-test
- Paired t-test is used to test hypotheses on the difference between two population means
- If data are not paired, use two-sample t-test as an alternative

#### Simulation Experiment for Test Power

Given two populations with mean $\mu_X=0$ and $\mu_Y=1$, and equal population variances, we want to test $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = 0$ against $H_1: \mu_X - \mu_Y \neq 0$ to find the difference in means. 

#### Paired t-Test Strategy

1. Calculate $D_i = X_i - Y_i$ for $i=1, \ldots, 8$.
2. Compute test statistic as $D/(s_D / \sqrt{8})$ where $s_D$ is the standard deviation of $D_i$.
3. Null distribution is Student's t with 7 degrees of freedom.
4. Reject $H_0$ if $|D/(s_D / \sqrt{8})| > 2.365$ at 5% significance level.

#### Two-Sample t-Test Comparison

For the two-sample t-test with equal population variances, the test statistic differs from the paired t-test.

#### Formula:
$$\frac{D}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}}} =\frac{D}{s_p/2}$$

#### Key Points:
- Null distribution is Student’s t with 14 degrees of freedom.
- Two-sample t-test rejects $H_0$ if $|D/(s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}})| > t_{14,.025} = 2.145$.
- Power is $P(|D/(s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}})| > 2.145$.

#### Power Calculation:
- Test statistics: $D^*/(s^*D/\sqrt{8})$ and $D^*/(s^*p/2)$
- Estimate power by computing the proportion of samples where test statistics exceed critical points: 2.365 for paired test, 2.145 for two-sample test.
- Power of tests depends on correlation between variables.

#### Evaluation:
- Generate 10,000 samples from N(0,1) and N(1,1) populations.
- Calculate test statistics and estimate power for each test.
- Compare powers to determine which test has greater power.

#### Generating Correlated Samples
Generate 10,000 samples $X^*_1, ..., X^*_8$ from an $N(0,1)$ population. Generate 10,000 samples $Z^*_1, ..., Z^*_8$ from an $N(0,1)$ population independent of $X^*$ values. Compute $Y_ki = 1 + 0.8X^*_k + 0.6Z^*_k$.

#### Testing and Power Estimation
Compute the test statistics and estimate the power of both tests. Having a correlation between $X^*_k$ and $Y^*_k$ of 0.8 indicates that large values of $X^*_k$ will tend to be paired with large values of $Y^*_k$. Determine which test has greater power.

The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the variability in measurements on the base metal is equal to or less than the variability in measurements on the weld ($\sigma_{\text{base metal}} \leq \sigma_{\text{weld}}$).

#### Concepts:

1. **Hypothesis Testing for Equal Means:**

The engineer is testing the null hypothesis that the mean weights of boxes from the two machines are equal. To compare means, the engineer calculated the F-statistic using the formula:

$$F = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} = 2.48$$

2. **Interpreting the F-Statistic:**

The engineer compared the calculated F-statistic (2.48) to the critical value at a significance level of 10% (5.39) for degrees of freedom 3 and 3. Since the calculated F value is lower than the critical value, the engineer did not reject the null hypothesis of equal variances.

3. **Validity of the Test:**

a. **Correctness of F-test:** The calculation of the F-test seems to be done correctly based on the information provided.

b. **Justification of Conclusion:** The conclusion that the variances are equal is justified based on the comparison of the calculated F-statistic with the critical value and the subsequent determination of the p-value.

#### Survey Sampling and Gender Distribution Analysis

\text{Wandersleben} & 38 & 60 & 118 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

**Analysis:** To assess if the age distributions differ between the two sites, further statistical analysis is required.

#### Educational Levels Among Three Indian States

We can perform a chi-square test to determine if the educational levels differ among the three states.

$H_0$: There is no difference in educational levels among the three states.

$H_a$: There is a difference in educational levels among the three states.

Compute the chi-square test statistic and compare it to the critical value at the 5% significance level with degrees of freedom $(r-1)(c-1)$, where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns.

If the computed chi-square statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in educational levels among the three states.

#### Bivariate Data Collection
- Scientists and engineers collect data to understand the relationship between two quantities.
- Often results in bivariate data as ordered pairs (x,y).

#### Linearity in Data
- Data points may fall along a straight line when plotted.

#### Equation for the Line
- Line equation can be computed from the data.
- Useful for predicting outcomes based on specific input values.

#### Correlation and Simple Linear Regression
- Techniques used to analyze relationships between variables.

#### Correlation

The correlation coefficient is used to describe how closely related two physical characteristics are. It was first introduced by Sir Francis Galton in 1888 through his study on the variation in physical characteristics in human populations.

#### Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is used to analyze bivariate data to determine if a straight-line fit is appropriate. It helps compute the equation of the line and draw inferences about the relationship between the two quantities.

#### Scatter Plot Analysis
The data by Galton consists of 348 ordered pairs $(x_i, y_i)$. The scatter plot indicates a positive association between height and forearm length, where taller men tend to have longer forearms. The points cluster around a straight line.

#### Least-Squares Line
The line superimposed on the plot is the least-squares line, which best fits the data and has a constant slope throughout. The least-squares line will be further discussed in Section 7.2.

#### Linear Relationship Strength

The degree of clustering around a least-squares line in a scatterplot reflects the strength of the linear relationship between variables $x$ and $y$. The correlation coefficient, denoted by $r$, is a numerical measure of this strength. 

#### Correlation Coefficient

- Numerical measure of linear relationship strength.
- Usually denoted by $r$.
- Several equivalent formulas exist.
- Represents clustering tendency around a line.

#### Calculation of Correlation Coefficient

Given $n$ points $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ on a scatterplot, the correlation coefficient $r$ can be computed using different formulas.

#### Correlation Calculation

To calculate the correlation between two variables, first, compute the means and standard deviations of the x-values ($\bar{x}$, $s_x$) and y-values ($\bar{y}$, $s_y$).
