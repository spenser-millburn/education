It relates the probability of transitioning from one state to another in a certain number of steps to the probabilities of doing so in fewer steps. Specifically, if $ P $ is the one-step transition probability matrix of a Markov chain, then the n-step transition probability matrix $ P^n $ can be computed using matrix multiplication, where $ P^n $ gives the probabilities of transitioning between states in exactly n steps.

    "2. **Two-Step Transition Probabilities**: The element at the $(i, j)$ position in the matrix $P^2$ (which is $P$ multiplied by itself) represents the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ in two steps. This is computed as:\n",

    "### Justification for This Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markov Property**: The fundamental assumption of a Markov chain is that the future state depends only on the current state and not on how the process arrived in the current state. This property allows us to consider only the immediate last state in calculations for transitions.\n",
    "- **Matrix Multiplication Corresponds to State Transitions**: Matrix multiplication naturally encapsulates the process of adding probabilities over all possible intermediate states, as required by the total probability theorem. Each entry in the resulting matrix $P^n$ represents the probability of transitioning from one state to another in $n$ steps, considering all possible paths.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: This method is computationally efficient and systematic, allowing for straightforward calculations using linear algebra tools. It also scales well for larger state spaces and longer time steps.\n",
