## [5.1] - Notes : Large Sample Confidence Intervals for a population mean

#### Large-Sample Confidence Intervals for a Population Mean

The goal is to estimate the population mean based on a sample.

- Confidence interval example: 68% confident the true value is in (13.9, 14.1)

- Steps:
    1. Take a random sample
    2. Calculate sample mean ($X$) and sample standard deviation ($s$)
    3. Construct a confidence interval around the sample mean
    4. Quantify level of confidence in covering the population mean

#### Confidence Interval for Population Mean

To construct a confidence interval for the population mean $ \mu $ when the population variance $ \sigma^2 $ is unknown, we can use the sample mean $ \bar{X} = 12.05 $ from a sample of 100 fill weights.

Under the Central Limit Theorem, $ \bar{X} $ comes from a normal distribution with mean $ \mu $ and standard deviation $ \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{100}} $.

The middle 95% of this normal distribution is represented by 1.96 standard deviations on either side of $ \mu $.

Thus, the confidence interval can be calculated as $ \bar{X} \pm 1.96 \times \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{100}} \right) $.

#### Sample Mean and Confidence Interval for Population Mean

$X$ is drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma_X=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. The 95% confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$ is $X \pm 1.96\sigma_X$, which covers the middle 95% of the distribution.

#### Coverage of Population Mean

Ninety-five percent of all possible samples fall within the 95% confidence interval. The interval $X \pm 1.96\sigma_X$ is the same length as the middle 95% of the distribution and covers the population mean $\mu$.

#### Unusual Sample Mean

If the sample mean $X$ lies outside the middle 95% of the distribution, only 5% of possible samples fall into this category.

#### Concept: 95% Confidence Interval

The 95% confidence interval $X \pm 1.96\sigma_X$ fails to cover the population mean $μ$.

In this case, we compute a 95% confidence interval for the mean fill weight. Given $X = 12.05$ and $s = 0.1$ as the sample standard deviation, we approximate the population mean fill weight $μ$ to be $(12.0304, 12.0696)$ at the 95% confidence level.

#### Confidence Interval for Population Mean
A 95% confidence interval for a population mean is calculated as $\bar{X} \pm 1.96\sigma_X$. This means that if this procedure is repeated multiple times, the population mean will be covered by the interval in approximately 95% of the cases.

#### Interpretation of Confidence Interval
It is important to note that the confidence interval gives a range within which the population mean is likely to fall. However, it does not guarantee that the specific sample mean is within this range. The sample could fall within the middle 95% of the distribution or be an outlier in the outer 5%.

#### Calculation of Confidence Intervals
We can use this same reasoning to compute intervals with various confidence levels.

- For a 68% confidence interval:
    - The interval extends a distance $1.0\sigma_X$ on either side of the population mean $\mu$.
    - The interval for the mean fill weight of the boxes is $12.05 \pm (1.0)(0.01)$, or $(12.04, 12.06)$.

- The 95% confidence interval is wider than the 68% confidence interval.
    - To increase confidence, the interval must be made wider.
    - A wider margin for error provides more coverage for the true population mean.

- Extreme cases:
    - 100% confidence: True population mean is in the infinitely wide interval $(-\infty, \infty)$.
    - 0% confidence: True population mean is in.

#### Confidence Interval Calculation

$[12.05, 12.05]$ that contains the sample mean and no other point.

#### Confidence Level and Z-Scores

Let $\alpha$ be a number between 0 and 1, and let $100(1 - \alpha)%$ denote the required confidence level.

#### Finding Z-Score

Define $z_{\alpha/2}$ to be the z-score that cuts off an area of $\alpha/2$ in the tails of the normal curve. For example, $z_{0.025}=1.96$ since 2.5% of the area under the standard normal curve is to the right of 1.96.

#### Confidence Interval Calculation

The confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$ is $X \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sigma_X$, or $X \pm z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ for a desired confidence level of $100(1 - \alpha)%$.

#### Sample Mean from Normal Distribution
$X \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$

#### Confidence Interval
The interval $X \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sigma_X$ covers the population mean $\mu$ for a proportion $1-\alpha$ of all samples that could possibly be drawn.

#### Approximation for Large Samples
Even for large samples, the distribution of $X$ is only approximately normal. The distinction between approximate and exact levels for confidence intervals is generally ignored in practice when the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to be used.

#### Confidence Intervals

Given a random sample $X_1, ..., X_n$ from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, with $X$ being approximately normal, a level $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ is:

$X \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sigma_X$

where $\sigma_X = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. When $\sigma$ is unknown, it can be replaced with the sample standard deviation $s$.

In particular,
- $X \pm s/\sqrt{n}$ is a 68% confidence interval for $\mu$.
- $X \pm 1.645s/\sqrt{n}$ is a 90% confidence interval for $\mu$.
- $X \pm 1.96s/\sqrt{n}$ is a 95% confidence interval for $\mu$.
- $X \pm 2.58s/\sqrt{n}$ is a 99% confidence interval for $\mu$.
- $X \pm 3s/\sqrt{n}$ is a 99.7% confidence interval for $\mu$.

#### Example 5.1

Given a sample mean $X=12.05$ and sample standard deviation $s=0.1$ for the fill weights of 100 boxes, we need to find an 85% confidence interval for the mean fill weight.

#### Solution

To find an 85% confidence interval, we set $1 - \alpha = 0.85$ to obtain $\alpha = 0.15$ and $\alpha/2 = 0.075$. By looking in the table for $z_{0.075}$, the z-score that cuts off 7.5% of the area in the right-hand tail, we find $z_{0.075} = 1.44$.

Approximating $\sigma_X \approx s/\sqrt{n}=0.01$, the 85% confidence interval would be:

$12.05 \pm 1.44(0.01)$

#### Given Data
- Sample size $(n) = 50$
- Sample mean $(\bar{X}) = 12.68$
- Sample standard deviation $(s) = 6.83$

#### Calculating Confidence Interval
- Population mean $(\mu)$ is unknown
- Confidence level $(1 - \alpha) = 0.95$

#### Formula for Confidence Interval
- Confidence interval: $\bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

#### Calculation
- Degrees of freedom $(df) = n - 1 = 49$
- From the t-distribution table, for a 95% confidence level and 49 degrees of freedom, $z_{\alpha/2} \approx 2.0096$

#### Result
- Confidence interval for the mean lifetime of microdrills: $12.68 \pm 2.0096 \times \frac{6.83}{\sqrt{50}}$


#### Key Concepts:

- The confidence level \(1 - \alpha\) is equal to 0.95, thus \(\alpha = 0.05\) and \(z_{\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} = 1.96\).

  $$\alpha = 0.05, \quad z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96.$$

- Approximating the population standard deviation \(\sigma\) with sample standard deviation \(s = 6.83\) gives \(\sigma_{\bar{X}} \approx \frac{6.83}{\sqrt{50}} = 0.9659\).

  $$\sigma_{\bar{X}} \approx 0.9659.$$

- The 95% confidence interval for the mean is \(12.68 \pm (1.96)(0.9659)\), which can be written as \(12.68 \pm 1.89\) or as \((10.79, 14.57)\).

- The standard error of the sample mean \(\text{SE Mean}\) is a measure of the precision of the sample mean, approximated by \(s / \sqrt{n}\).

- To find an 80% confidence interval, set \(1 - \alpha = 0.80\) to obtain \(\alpha = 0.20\).

  $$\alpha = 0.20.$$

- Look up \(z_{0.10}\), the z-score that cuts off 10% of the area in the right-hand tail, to calculate the 80% confidence interval.

#### Confidence Interval Calculation

When calculating a confidence interval with a confidence level of 80% for a given mean ($\bar{X}$) and standard deviation (s), the interval is $\bar{X} \pm z \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$. For example, a 80% confidence interval for a mean of 12.68 with a standard deviation of 0.9659 can be written as (11.44, 13.92).

#### Determining Confidence Level

To determine the confidence level of a given confidence interval, solve for $z_{\alpha/2}$ using the formula $\bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$. In a specific example with $\bar{X}$ = 12.68, s = 6.83, and n = 50, if an engineer reported a confidence interval of (11.09, 14.27), the confidence level turns out to be 90%.

#### Confidence Intervals

A **level $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence interval** is one computed by a method that will succeed in covering the population mean a proportion $1 - \alpha$ of the times it is used.

- When computing a confidence interval, one must decide what **level of confidence** to use.
- **Higher confidence levels** imply **less precision** in the interval.
- For example, a **68% confidence interval** specifies the population mean within $±1.0\sigma_X$, while a **95% confidence interval** specifies it within $±1.96\sigma_X$.
- **Figure 5.4** illustrates the trade-off between confidence and precision.

#### More About Confidence Levels

- **Confidence levels** measure the **reliability of the interval** method.
- Intervals with **greater confidence levels** are **less precise**.
- For a **95% confidence interval**, it covers the population mean $1- \alpha$ of the time.

#### Confidence Intervals
The confidence intervals are different due to different sample means $X$. About 95% of these intervals cover the population mean $\mu$.

#### Precision and Coverage
68% confidence intervals are more precise but may fail to cover $\mu$. 99.7% confidence intervals are reliable with very few failures in the long run.

#### Practiced Confidence Levels
95% confidence level is commonly used providing a good balance between reliability and precision. Confidence levels below 90% are rarely used for most applications.

#### Probability versus Confidence

In statistical inference, **probability** refers to random events, where outcomes may vary upon repetition. On the other hand, **confidence** in a statistical context does not involve randomness.

For instance, in the context of a **95% confidence interval** $(12.304, 12.696)$ for a population mean $\mu$, it is incorrect to say there is a 95% probability that $\mu$ falls within this range. Instead, we have 95% confidence that the population mean is within this interval.

When discussing a method to compute such intervals, it is accurate to say that the method successfully captures the population mean 95% of the time and fails 5% of the time.

#### Large-Sample Confidence Intervals for a Population Mean

The confidence interval is a range of values that likely contains the population mean. It is not a guarantee, but a way to estimate with a certain level of confidence.

$$\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm z \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$$

- **68% Confidence Interval**: Covers the population mean only about 68% of the time, which is not very reliable.
- **95% Confidence Interval**: Represents a good compromise between reliability and precision for many purposes.
- **99.7% Confidence Interval**: Extremely reliable but imprecise, fail to cover the population mean only three times in 1000.

#### Example
Consider a 90% confidence interval, which falls between the reliability of a 95% and a 99.7% confidence interval.

#### Confidence Interval: Mean Diameter of Steel Rods
$CI = (14.73, 14.91)$

**False:** The probability that the mean diameter falls within the confidence interval is not exactly 90%. It is a range in which the population mean either lies or doesn't.

#### Engineer's Plan for Confidence Interval
She will use the formula:
$CI = \bar{x} \pm 1.645 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

**True:** The probability that the population mean diameter falls within this confidence interval is indeed 90%.

#### Confidence Intervals and Probability

In statistics, a method for computing a 90% confidence interval has a probability of 90% in covering the population mean.

#### Example

A team of geologists plans to measure the weights of 250 rocks and compute a 95% confidence interval for each weight. What is the probability that more than 240 of these intervals will cover the true weights of the rocks?

#### Solution

For the 250 confidence intervals to cover the true weights, we treat each interval as a Bernoulli trial. Since the weighing procedure is unbiased, each interval covering the true weight is a success, with the probability linked to the accuracy of the interval.

#### Confidence Interval for Population Mean
A 95% confidence interval covers the population mean 95% of the time. The success probability for each Bernoulli trial is 0.95.

The number of confidence intervals that cover the true weight, Y, follows a Binomial distribution with parameters \(n = 250\) and \(p = 0.95\), which can be approximated by a Normal distribution with mean 237.5 and standard deviation 3.45.

The probability that \(Y > 240\) is 0.1922.

#### Sample Size for Confidence Interval Width
In Example 5.2, a 95% confidence interval was (10.79, 14.57) with a width of 1.89. Determining the sample size needed for a confidence interval of a specified width.

#### Calculating Sample Size for Confidence Interval

Given a desired confidence level $1-\alpha$, the width of a confidence interval for a population mean based on a sample of size $n$ drawn from a population with standard deviation $\sigma$ is $\pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

To find the sample size needed for a specified width of the confidence interval:
$$(z_{\alpha/2})\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = \text{desired width}$$

In a practical example with a 95% confidence level and a known standard deviation estimate, with $z_{\alpha/2}=1.96$ and a desired width of ±0.50, the necessary sample size to achieve this interval width is calculated as follows:
$$(1.96)\left(\frac{6.83}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = 0.50$$
Solving for $n$, we find $n=717$, which is then rounded up to $n=717$.

#### Confidence Intervals
The standard deviation of weights from 100 boxes was $s=0.1$ oz. The formula to find the necessary sample size for a 99% confidence interval of width $\pm0.012$ oz is given by $(2.58)(0.1)/\sqrt{n} = 0.012$. Solving for $n$, we get $n \approx 463$.

#### One-Sided Confidence Intervals
One-sided confidence intervals are used when only a lower or upper bound is needed. For example, in estimating the mean crushing strength of a certain type of concrete block, a reliability engineer may be interested in only a lower bound for applications specifying a minimum strength.

#### One-Sided Confidence Interval for Population Mean μ

$X<μ+1.645σ_X$

Interval: $(X-1.645σ_X, ∞)$ covers μ.

If sample mean is in upper 5% of its distribution, interval will fail to cover μ.

95% one-sided confidence interval for μ: $(X-1.645σ_X, ∞)$

95% lower confidence bound for μ: $X-1.645σ_X$

#### Confidence Interval

A confidence interval for the population mean μ is given by $ (X - 1.645\sigma_X, \infty) $. Constructing a figure with the lower 5% tail shaded shows that $ X + 1.645\sigma_X $ is a 95% upper confidence bound for μ.

To generalize one-sided confidence intervals of any desired level, define $ z_\alpha $ as the z-score that cuts off an area α in the right-hand tail of the normal curve. For a level 100(1-α)% lower confidence bound for μ, use $ X - z_\alpha\sigma_X $, and for a level 100(1-α)% upper confidence bound, use $ X + z_\alpha\sigma_X $.

#### Summary

For a random sample $ X_1, ..., X_n $ from a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ, where n > 30 and X is approximately normal:

- Lower confidence bound for μ: $ X - z_\alpha\sigma_X $
- Upper confidence bound for μ: $ X + z_\alpha\sigma_X $

Here, $ \sigma_X = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $. If the value of σ is unknown, it can be replaced with the sample standard deviation.

#### Large-Sample Confidence Intervals for a Population Mean

- $X + 1.28 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ is a 90% upper confidence bound for $μ$.
- $X + 1.645 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ is a 95% upper confidence bound for $μ$.
- $X + 2.33 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ is a 99% upper confidence bound for $μ$.

The corresponding lower bounds are found by replacing the "+" with "−."

#### Example 5.9

Refer to Example 5.2. Find both a 95% lower confidence bound and a 99% upper confidence bound for the mean lifetime of the microdrills.

Solution:
- Given: $X=12.68$, $s=6.83$, $n=50$.
- Estimated $\sigma_X \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 0.9659$.
- The 95% lower confidence bound is $X - 1.645\sigma_X = 11.09$.
- The 99% upper confidence bound is $X + 2.33\sigma_X = 14.93$.

In Example 5.2, the 95% two-sided confidence interval was computed to be (10.79, 14.57). The 95% lower confidence bound of 11.09 is greater than the lower bound of the two-sided confidence interval.

#### Two-sided interval failure
A two-sided interval can fail if the value of $μ$ is either too high or too low. The 95% confidence interval is designed to fail 2.5% of the time on the high side and 2.5% of the time on the low side.

#### Lower confidence bound failure
The 95% lower confidence bound never fails on the high side but is designed to fail 5% of the time on the low side. Therefore, its lower limit is greater than that of the two-sided interval.

#### Importance of random samples
Confidence intervals must be based on random samples to ensure meaningful results. Using methods without random sampling may lead to inaccurate conclusions.

#### Violation of random sampling assumption
- **Example:** A chemical engineer wants to estimate the mean yield of a new process based on 100 runs over several days. However, if the data is not from a random sample, computing a confidence interval may not be appropriate.

#### Importance of Random Sampling

The validity of expression (5.1) in statistical analysis depends on the data being a random sample from a population. If there is a clear pattern, such as cyclic behavior or influence from previous values, the assumption of independence may be violated, rendering the use of the expression inappropriate.

#### Application to Yield Analysis

In the context of yield analysis, if the data exhibit a cyclic pattern or are influenced by previous values, as shown in Figure 5.7 and 5.8, it suggests that the observations are not from a random sample. In such cases, expression (5.1) should not be used for making inferences about the population characteristics.

#### Confidence Interval for the Mean Yield
To compute a confidence interval for the mean yield of this process, we need more analysis to account for the increasing trend of yields with time. There might be a learning effect where yields improve over time as the operator gains experience.

#### Large-Sample Confidence Intervals
Given the increasing trend in yields with time, a more detailed analysis is needed. The data may need to be divided into segments to account for the learning effect. Subsequently, a confidence interval can be constructed using only the relevant data points.

#### Value of zα/2
The value of $z_{\alpha/2}$ can be found using the specific confidence level required in expression (5.1) to construct a confidence interval. It represents the critical value corresponding to the desired confidence level.

#### 1. Levels of Confidence Intervals

a. $z_{\alpha/2}=1.64$

b. $z_{\alpha/2}=2.33$

c. $z_{\alpha/2}=2.58$

d. $z_{\alpha/2}=1.28$

#### 2. Impact of Confidence Level

As the confidence level goes up, the reliability goes __up__, and the precision goes __down__.

#### 3. Confidence Intervals for Traffic Flow Improvement

Given a mean improvement of 654.1 vehicles per hour and a standard deviation of 311.7 vehicles per hour in 50 simulations:

a. For 95% confidence: $CI: (628.67, 679.53)$

b. For a 98% confidence interval: $n \approx \left( \dfrac{Z \times \sigma}{E} \right)^2$ where $Z = 2.33$

#### 3. Confidence Intervals for Breaking Strength

b. 99% confidence interval: $(\bar{x} - Z \times \dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{x} + Z \times \dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}})$

#### 4. Confidence Level for Engineer's Claim
The engineer's claim can be made with a confidence level of 100%.

#### 5. Sample Size for Specifying Mean Breaking Strength
a. For a 95% confidence interval specifying mean breaking strength to within ±0.3 kN: $n \approx \left( \dfrac{Z \times \sigma}{E} \right)^2$ where $Z = 1.96$
b. For a 99% confidence interval specifying mean breaking strength to within ±0.3 kN: $n \approx \left( \dfrac{Z \times \sigma}{E} \right)^2$ where $Z = 2.58$
