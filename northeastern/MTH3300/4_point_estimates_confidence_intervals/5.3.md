#### Confidence Intervals for Population Mean

When we have a large sample (i.e., $n > 30$) from a population with a known mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, and the sample mean $\bar{X}$ approximates a normal distribution, the confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$ is given by:
$$
\bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
where:
- $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the z-score that captures the critical values from the standard normal distribution.
- $\sigma_X = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ is the standard error of the mean.

If $\sigma$ is unknown, it is replaced by the sample standard deviation $s$, giving the formula:
$$
\bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Specifically, the confidence intervals for different confidence levels are:
- **68% Confidence Interval:** 
  $$
  \bar{X} \pm s\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
- **90% Confidence Interval:** 
  $$

  \bar{X} \pm 1.645 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
- **95% Confidence Interval:** 
  $$
  \bar{X} \pm 1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
- **99% Confidence Interval:** 
  $$
  \bar{X} \pm 2.58 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
- **99.7% Confidence Interval:**
  $$
  \bar{X} \pm 3 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

#### Large-Sample Confidence Intervals for a Population Mean

The confidence interval for a population mean can be determined from a sample mean and sample standard deviation. Given a confidence level $(1 - \alpha)$:

- **Sample Mean, $\bar{X}$**: Average of sample observations.
- **Sample Standard Deviation, $s$**: Standard deviation of the sample.
- **Standard Error of the Mean, $\sigma_{\bar{X}}$**: Estimated by $\sigma_{\bar{X}} \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $n$ is the sample size.

The formula for a confidence interval at a $95\%$ confidence level, where $z_{\alpha/2} \approx 1.96$ (from the standard normal distribution), is:
  
$$
\bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \times \sigma_{\bar{X}}
$$

For large samples (typically $n \geq 30$), this approximation becomes more accurate. This method assumes that the sample represents a random sampling from a normally distributed population. Adjustments may need to be made if these conditions are not met.

#### One-Sample Z Test: Important Concepts

- **Standard Error of the Mean (SE Mean):**
  The SE Mean is the standard deviation of the sample mean, represented mathematically as:
  $$
  \sigma_X = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
  where $s$ is the sample standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size. It is used to estimate the variation or the standard deviation of sampling distributions of the mean.

- **95% Confidence Interval (CI):**
  In the context of the Z test with the above example, the 95% CI for the mean is given by:

  $$
  \text{CI} = (\text{Mean} - Z_{0.025} \times SE, \ \text{Mean} + Z_{0.025} \times SE)
  $$

  Where $Z_{0.025}$ is the z-value leaving 2.5% in the upper tail of the standard normal distribution. In the example, this computed as $(10.786821, 14.573179)$. 

- **Finding a Specific Confidence Interval:**
  To find an 80% CI from a given mean, standard error, and appropriate z-value (z-score corresponding to 80%), the interval is:
  $$
  \text{CI} = \text{Mean} \pm (Z_{\text{score for 80\% CI}} \times SE)
  $$
  Plugging in values, it computes to $(11.44, 13.92)$ using $Z_{\text{score for 80\% CI}} = 1.28$.

- **Determining Confidence Level of a Reported Interval:**
  If a specific confidence interval is provided (e.g., $(11.09, 14.27)$), the level of confidence can often be reverse calculated using the related z-score that reflects the range's cutoffs. This involves checking how the calculated mean ± z-value × SE fits within the given interval.

#### Confidence Interval Formula
The confidence interval for estimating the population mean with known standard deviation is given by:

$$
\text{CI} = \overline{X} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
$$

Where:
- $\overline{X}$ is the sample mean.
- $s$ is the sample standard deviation.
- $n$ is the sample size.
- $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical z-value from the standard normal distribution that corresponds to the desired confidence level.

#### Determining $z_{\alpha/2}$ and $\alpha$
From the given problem setup, if the upper confidence limit is solved as 14.27 using $\overline{X} = 12.68$, $s = 6.83$, and $n = 50$, and results in:

$$
14.27 = 12.68 + z_{\alpha/2}\left(\frac{6.83}{\sqrt{50}}\right)
$$

Solving for $z_{\alpha/2}$ from the above equation yields $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.646$. Consulting the z-table provides that $\alpha/2$ (the area to the right of $z_{\alpha/2}$) is approximately 0.05, resulting in a confidence level of 90%.

#### More About Confidence Levels
Confidence levels measure the reliability or consistency of the method used for interval construction. The level of $100(1-\alpha)\%$ indicates that the method, in the long run, will successfully cover the population mean $(1-\alpha)$ proportion of times it is used.

A higher confidence level yields a larger interval, reflecting more uncertainty about the precision of the estimated population mean. Hence, there's a trade-off between the confidence level and interval precision:

- A 68% confidence interval has a narrower range, specifying the mean to within $\pm1$ standard error.
- A 95% confidence interval expands this range to $\pm1.96$ standard errors, providing greater reliability at the cost of less precision. 

Choosing the right confidence level depends on the specific requirements and tolerance for risk in a given analysis or application.

#### Confidence Intervals and Their Precision

- **Confidence Interval (CI)**: Reflects a range likely to contain the population mean, μ, based on sample data. Different samples lead to different CIs.

- **Level of Confidence**:
  - Common choices: 68%, 95%, 99.7%. 
  - **95% CI:** Most commonly used; balances reliability and precision, meaning it is likely to contain the true mean 95% of the time in repeated sampling.
  - **68% CI:** More precise (narrower) than 95% CI but less reliable; fails more often to cover the true mean.
  - **99.7% CI:** Very reliable (only 0.3% chance of not covering the true mean) but less precise (wider), providing less detailed information.
  
- **Precision vs. Reliability Trade-off**:
  - Higher confidence level (e.g., 99.7%) increases reliability but reduces precision.
  - Lower confidence level (e.g., 68%) increases precision but reduces reliability. 

- **Practical Use**: 
  - CIs below 90% are rarely used due to reduced reliability.
  - A 95% CI is optimal for many applications, offering a good compromise between covering the true mean and providing a narrower interval.

#### Probability versus Confidence

The concept of probability and confidence are frequently misunderstood as being interchangeable in statistics; however, they represent fundamentally different aspects of statistical inference:

- **Probability** pertains to the likelihood of different outcomes occurring within random events. If an experiment or process is repeated under identical conditions, probability measures the frequency with which specific outcomes are expected to occur.

- **Confidence**, on the other hand, relates to the degree of certainty we have regarding the accuracy of a statistical estimate. For instance, a 95% confidence interval does not imply that there is a 95% chance the true parameter (like a population mean) falls within the reported interval. Instead, it means that if we were to repeat the sample and calculation numerous times, approximately 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true parameter.

- When we say that "we are 95% confident," we are indicating our trust level in the reliability of the method used to compute the interval, not the probability that the parameter lies within any particular interval.

- **Confidence Intervals and Fixed Numbers**: In the context of confidence intervals, the endpoints of the interval (like 12.304 and 12.696 in a calculated confidence interval for a mean) are fixed after they are calculated. They do not change, hence there is no "probability" directly associated with them. The parameter being estimated (such as a population mean) is also a fixed number, although unknown. Thus, the interval either contains the true parameter value, or it does not.

This distinction is critical for the correct interpretation of statistical results and for avoiding common misconceptions about what statistical measures actually convey.

#### Confidence Intervals for a Population Mean

- **Confidence Interval (CI) Concept**: A confidence interval is an estimate of an interval in statistics that might contain a population parameter. The confidence level is the probability that the interval estimate will include the true population parameter if the experiment is repeated multiple times.

- **Confidence Levels**:
    - 68% Confidence Interval: These intervals fail to cover the population mean about 32% of the time. Due to this high failure rate, 68% CIs are generally not reliable for practical purposes.
    - 95% Confidence Interval: A 95% CI is usually a good compromise between reliability and precision for many purposes and is frequently used in statistical analysis.
    - 99.7% Confidence Interval: These intervals are highly reliable, failing to cover the population mean only three times out of 1000. However, they are less precise due to their wide range.

- **Misinterpretation of Confidence Interval**:
    - It is a common misconception to interpret a confidence interval as the probability that the true parameter lies within the interval given a single computed interval. This is incorrect as the confidence interval relates to the long-term frequency of the intervals containing the parameter if the same process is repeated multiple times.

#### Confidence Intervals and Probability Interpretation

Confidence intervals are used to estimate the range in which a population parameter likely falls. Two key concepts concerning them include:

- **Fixed Interval**: For a specific confidence interval calculated from a sample, saying there is a "probability" that this particular interval includes the population mean is incorrect. A stated interval either contains the mean or it doesn't. We can only express our confidence level (e.g., 90%) that the method used to construct the interval generally includes the mean.

  For example, if we say we are "90% confident that the population mean is between 14.73 and 14.91," this does not imply that there is a 90% probability the mean falls in this range after the fact. The term 'probability’ is inappropriate in this specific instance.

- **Interval Calculation Method**: When a confidence interval does not have an explicit numeric range but is described by a method that will be used to construct intervals (e.g., $\bar{X} \pm 1.645\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ for 90% confidence), it is correct to say that there is a 90% probability the interval created by this method contains the population mean. This is because, prior to calculation, the methodological approach has a theoretical reliability based on statistical theory.


#### Confidence Intervals and Bernoulli Trials

When computing confidence intervals for a population parameter (like the weight of rocks), each interval can be considered a Bernoulli trial. If the interval successfully covers the true population parameter, it is counted as a success. For example, a 95% confidence interval will statistically cover the true parameter 95% of the time, making the success probability for each trial 0.95.

#### Binomial and Normal Approximation

For a large sample size (n), the distribution of successes in Bernoulli trials can be approximated by a normal distribution. If each of 250 intervals is a Bernoulli trial with success probability 0.95:

- Let $Y$ be the number of intervals that cover the true parameter.
- Then, $Y \sim Bin(250, 0.95)$.
- Approximating this binomial with a normal distribution, we get $Y \approx N(237.5, 11.875)$.

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{11.875} = 3.45 $$

This standard deviation helps in further calculations like determining the probability that $Y$ exceeds a particular value using the normal distribution.

#### Probability Calculation Using Normal Distribution

Using the normal curve and considering the continuous nature of the normal distribution (continuity correction):

- The probability that $Y > 240$ is calculated to be 0.1922, based on the normal approximation and the positioning of 240.5 (considering the continuity correction) relative to the mean and standard deviation of the normally approximated distribution.

#### Determining Sample Size for a Confidence Interval of Specified Width

When a narrower confidence interval is required for estimating the mean of a population, the sample size must be increased. To compute the necessary sample size to achieve a confidence interval with a specific width, use the formula:

$$ \text{Width of CI} = z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$

Where:
- $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the z-distribution for a given confidence level.
- $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.
- $n$ is the sample size.

To find the sample size $n$ required to achieve a specific confidence interval width, rearrange the formula:

$$ n = \left( \frac{z_{\alpha/2} \sigma}{\text{Width of CI}} \right)^2 $$

In cases where a 95% confidence level is used with a known standard deviation, the critical value $(z_{\alpha/2})$ for 95% confidence is typically 1.96. The desired width of the CI informs the necessary computation for $n$. For instance, to achieve a CI width of ±0.50 with a standard deviation of 6.83:

$$ n = \left( \frac{1.96 \times 6.83}{0.50} \right)^2 \approx 717 $$

Thus, the sample size should be increased to approximately 717 to reduce the width of the confidence interval to ±0.50 in this example.

#### One-Sided Confidence Intervals

One-sided confidence intervals are used when only a lower or upper confidence bound is of interest, rather than both. This is common in situations where the specification for a process or product involves a minimum or maximum acceptable value. With a one-sided confidence interval, the emphasis is on estimating either a minimum possible value or a maximum possible value, but not both.

##### Key Concepts:

- **Definition**: A one-sided confidence interval provides a range that includes either all values above a certain point (lower bound) or all values below a certain point (upper bound), but not both.
- **Usage**: Typically used when the requirement is to ensure a threshold is either not exceeded or not gone below (e.g., minimum strength of materials, maximum allowable emissions).
- **Calculation**: Similar to two-sided intervals, but the z-value or t-value used corresponds to the confidence level for one tail of the distribution.

For example, in industrial applications such as determining the strength of a material, only the lower bound may be necessary to ensure the material meets safety standards. This is useful for quality control and compliance with safety regulations.

#### One-Sided Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean $\mu$

- **Normal Distribution of Sample Mean**: The sample mean $X$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma_X = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

- **95% Lower Confidence Interval**: The interval $(X - 1.645 \sigma_X, \infty)$ represents a 95% one-sided confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$, where $1.645$ is the z-value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to a 95% confidence level (leaving 5% in the upper tail). The expression $X - 1.645 \sigma_X$ is referred to as the 95% lower confidence bound for $\mu$.

- **Generalization to Other Confidence Levels**: To construct one-sided confidence intervals for any desired confidence level:
  - Calculate the appropriate z-value, denoted as $z_\alpha$, where $\alpha$ represents the tail probability (e.g., for a 90% confidence level, $\alpha = 0.10$).
  - The one-sided lower confidence interval can then be formed as $(X - z_\alpha \sigma_X, \infty)$.
  - Similarly, for an upper confidence bound, the interval is $(-\infty, X + z_\alpha \sigma_X)$.

- **Concept of Coverage**: This type of interval will fail to cover $\mu$ only if the sample mean $X$ lies in the critical region of its distribution (e.g., the upper 5% for a lower 95% confidence interval).

#### Z-Score and Confidence Intervals
The z-score, denoted as $z_{\alpha}$, is critical in determining confidence intervals in statistics. This score represents the point that cuts off an area $\alpha$ in the right-hand tail of the normal distribution curve. For instance, $z_{0.05} = 1.645$ indicates the z-score that excludes the top 5% of data.

#### Calculating Confidence Bounds
For a large sample size ($n>30$), assume the sample is drawn from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. The sample mean $X$ is then normally distributed, allowing the derivation of confidence bounds for the population mean:

- **Lower Confidence Bound:** 
  $$
  X - z_{\alpha} \sigma_X
  $$
  Here, $\sigma_X = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, representing the standard error of the mean.

- **Upper Confidence Bound:** 
  $$
  X + z_{\alpha} \sigmaX
  $$

If the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is unknown, it is replaced by the sample standard deviation $s$.

#### Practical Application
For estimating the population mean $\mu$, following bounds can be used, with $s$ replacing $\sigma$ where $\sigma$ is unknown:

- **90% Confidence Bound:**
  $$
  X \pm 1.28 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

- **95% Confidence Bound:**
  $$
  X \pm 1.645 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

- **99% Confidence Bound:**
  $$
  X \pm 2.33 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

These formulas provide a straightforward way to calculate confidence intervals for the population mean when the sample is large and normally distributed, either known or estimated standard deviation.

#### Important Concepts of Confidence Intervals and Sampling

##### Estimating Standard Error
The standard error ($\sigma_X$) of the mean is estimated by:
$$
\sigma_X \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
where $s$ is the sample standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size.

##### Confidence Bounds
- **95% Lower Confidence Bound:**
$$
X - 1.645 \times \sigma_X
$$
- **99% Upper Confidence Bound:**
$$
X + 2.33 \times \sigma_X
$$
These bounds provide limits within which the population parameter (mean, in this case) is expected to fall, with a certain degree of confidence.

##### Comparison of Single-Sided and Two-Sided Confidence Intervals
- The lower bound of a 95% one-sided confidence interval is higher than that of a 95% two-sided interval. This is because the one-sided interval only accounts for error in one direction (either too high or too low), leading to a more conservative (higher or lower) bound.

##### Necessity of Random Sampling
Confidince intervals are valid when the data comes from a random sample of the population. If the data are not randomly sampled, the resulting confidence intervals might not accurately reflect the population's characteristics. This could lead to incorrect inferences or decisions based on the data.

#### Importance of Random Sampling in Statistical Analysis

- The validity of expression (5.1) for computing confidence intervals requires that the data used are a random sample from the population. This ensures that each sample point is independent of the others.
- If the data show patterns or cycles as depicted in a plot (like Figure 5.7), it suggests non-random sampling, which can be due to influences between consecutive data points or external conditions affecting the data.
- When data are not randomly sampled, using standard formulas for confidence intervals (like expression 5.1) can lead to incorrect conclusions, as these formulas assume independence among the sampled points.

#### Key Concepts in Data Sampling and Trend Analysis

1. **Non-Random Sampling**: The data collected does not constitute a random sample, as it shows an increasing trend over time. This is important because statistical methods and conclusions derived from non-random samples may be biased and not generalize to the broader population.

2 optimizing Consequential 
2. **Implication for Statistical Analysis**: When data exhibits trends such as the increase seen here, it is inappropriate to use methods assuming independent and identically distributed samples, such as the formula for computing a confidence interval from independent samples (e.g., expression (5.1)).

3. **Alternatives for Trending Data**: Analysis techniques acknowledging and accounting for trends and dependencies in the data (time series analysis, regression models considering time as a covariate) should be considered to achieve more reliable and valid conclusions.
