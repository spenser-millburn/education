    "```\n",
    "Conditional probabilities are used  because they allow for the incorporation of the influence of past and present events on future outcomes, reflecting the dependency between events over time. If absolute probabilities were used, it would imply that events are independent of each other, with past and present events having no bearing on future occurrences.\n",

    "The word \"homogeneous\" in the context of Markov processes refers to the property that the transition probabilities are independent of time. That is, for a homogeneous Markov process, the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ is the same at any time step:\n",
