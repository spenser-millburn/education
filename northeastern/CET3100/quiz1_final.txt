PART D: Short Answer Questions 

1. Name and briefly define the seven layers of the OSI model.  
from week 2 assignment :
The OSI (Open System Interconnect) model is an internationally recognized standard for all networking and communication systems. It was established by ISO in an attempt to promote/regulate uniform interfaces between the various components of communication infrastructure. In addition to this, the OSI model provides protocol abstraction. Each layer is intended to be orthogonal to one another, such that changing a protocol limits the impact to one specific layer and doesn't break the internet... The OSI model has seven layers 

The application layer: This represents real world applications that provide an interface to the user.
The presentation layer: provides encoding of data. translates data from the application layer into the format required by the host. 
The Session Layer: Maintains sessions between remote hosts. 
The Transport layer: TCP/UDP . The transport layer defines how data is to be transmitted between the source and the destination. 
The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding and routing through various jump hosts and routers.
The Data Link Layer: Responsible for transferring data between nodes on a network segment across the physical layer. Ethernet is an example of a data-link protocol
The Physical Layer: Represents all circuits (routers/switches etc) and cabling required to facilitate communications on the network.
 

The TCP/IP,was developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency to organize the communication protocols that compose the internet. It contains four layers.

The application layer: enables the user to interact with the network. Hyperlink transfer such as http and https provide an entrypoint into the internet stack. These are examples of application layer protocols
The transport layer: TCP . In TCP/IP, TCP is used to ensure data arrives at its destination. It is used to define how data flows between hosts. NOTICE: UDP is not possible with TCP/IP . It was introduced as an alternative to TCP in real time critical applications such as streaming. UDP does not guarantee packaet delivery, whereas TCP does. 
The internet layer: IP or internet protocol facilitates host addressing and IP address routing. 
The link layer : similar to the OSI model data-link layer, but is independent of hardware and networking architecture. 
 

2.  Is stop-and-wait ARQ a half duplex protocol or a full duplex protocol? Explain your response.
stop-and-wait aaa is a half duplex protocol because it requires that the sender wait for an acknowledgment from the receiver before sending the next packet. 

3. Describe the function of a switch.  At what layer of the OSI model does it operate?

a switch is a device used in computer networks to connect multiple devices together and to forward data packets between those devices based on their MAC addresses. the switch operates at the data link layer

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of fibre optic cable?
Advantages: 

pros 
high bandwidth

emi resistant 

durable

low signal loss/attenuation

cons

cost 

requires special equipment

requires routing in advance and may not be available in rural areas. 

fragile


5. What is the difference between a deterministic and non-deterministic protocol?
deterministic: the outcom of communication can be determined based on a set of predetermined conditions.  
non-deterministic: the outcome cannot be based on a pretermined set of conditions. 

6. What is the data transfer rate in bps of a signal that is encoded using phase modulation with eight different phase angles and a baud rate of 3000?

bits per baud = log2(number of phase angles) = log2(8) = 3 bits per baud

data transfer rate in bps = bits per baud * Baud rate = 3 * 3000 = 9000 bps.


7. Name four (4) types of multiplexing giving a brief explanation of each.

Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM): a method of transmitting multiple signals simultaneously over a single communication channel by dividing the channel into different frequency bands, each carrying a separate signal.
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):a method of transmitting multiple signals over a single communication channel by dividing the channel into time slots, with each signal taking turns to use the channel for a specific amount of time.
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM):  a method of transmitting multiple signals over a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths of light for each signal.
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA): a method of transmitting multiple signals over a single communication channel by assigning a unique code to each signal, allowing all signals to be transmitted simultaneously without interference.

8. Define the main differences between the TCP and UDP protocols.

 TCP provides reliable data transfer with error checking and retransmission of lost or corrupted packets this reliability comes at the cost of slower speed due to the overhead required for error checking. 
 TCP is also a connection-oriented protocol, requiring a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver. 
 UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides faster, but unreliable data transfer with no guarantee of delivery or accuracy. 
 UDP is often used for real-time applications that require low latency and don't require reliable data transmission such as video or audio streaming.
